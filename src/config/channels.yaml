# YouTube Channel Monitoring Configuration
# =========================================
#
# Add YouTube channel IDs to monitor for new videos.
# The system will check these channels daily and automatically
# process new videos through the summarizer pipeline.
#
# How to find a channel ID:
# 1. Go to the YouTube channel page
# 2. View page source (Ctrl+U or Cmd+Option+U)
# 3. Search for "channelId" - it starts with "UC" and is 24 characters
#
# Or use the RSS feed URL pattern to verify:
# https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
