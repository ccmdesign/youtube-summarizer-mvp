## TL;DR
- Provides a responsive top navigation bar with branding and primary links.
- Slot allows teams to drop in custom logos or product names.
- Uses cluster utility tokens so spacing matches GOV.UK and USWDS headers.
- Designed to compose into `ccmHero` or standalone layout shells.

## Overview
ccmTopbar is the lightweight header bar for design system sites. It surfaces brand identity on the left and a concise navigation cluster on the right, making it ideal for documentation sites, marketing pages, or internal tools.

## When to use
- Present global navigation links at the top of a layout or hero.
- Embed consistent branding across multiple Nuxt pages.
- Provide quick access to top-level routes (Home, Docs, Blog, etc.).
- Prototype headers without wiring an entire layout system.

## When not to use
- Complex mega menus; build a dedicated navigation system instead.
- Applications that already define a shell header (avoid duplicates).
- Mobile-first experiences requiring hamburger menus—extend with responsive logic.
- Contexts where the header must include search/forms; compose additional components alongside the topbar.

## Anatomy
- **Wrapper (`.topbar`)** – Cluster layout aligning logo and navigation horizontally.
- **Logo slot** – Defaults to a NuxtLink “site name”; replace with `<img>` or `<ccmLogo>` as needed.
- **Navigation (`<nav>`)** – Unordered list of NuxtLinks using `.menu__item` styling.
- **Tokens** – Link colours, spacing, and typography driven by design tokens.

## Variants
- **Default** – Inline links with underline on hover; works on light backgrounds.
- **Hero integration** – Slot into `ccmHero`’s `#top-bar` for hero experiences.
- **Dark theme** – Override `--link-color`/`--link-color-visited` tokens globally for dark backgrounds.

## States
- **Idle** – Text inherits base colour tokens.
- **Hover** – Link underlined to align with GOV.UK link guidelines.
- **Visited** – Colour token `--link-color-visited` differentiates visited pages.
- **Focus** – Rely on shared focus outline tokens; ensure they remain visible atop hero backgrounds.

## API
| Name | Type | Default | Description | Required |
|------|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| _TBD_ | `unknown` | `-` | Populate after running prompts. | No |
## Accessibility
- Navigation wrapper uses `<nav role="navigation">`; ensure only one landmark per region or add `aria-label` when composing multiple navs.
- Provide alt text for custom logos and ensure focus order flows left-to-right.
- Links are real `NuxtLink`/`<a>` elements with keyboard/focus support.
- On small screens, consider adding additional responsive behaviour (e.g., collapse into menu) in a host component.

## Content guidance
- Limit navigation items to 3–5 top-level routes; overflow menus degrade discoverability.
- Use concise nouns (“Docs”, “Blog”, “Pricing”) and sentence case.
- Align the brand tone with GOV.UK/USWDS headers—avoid all caps or decorative text.
- Localise route labels and ensure the logo slot displays locale-specific branding if required.

## Implementation notes
- Component source: `src/components/ds/molecules/ccmTopbar.vue`
- Built with `.cluster` utility; adjust spacing by overriding design tokens rather than editing component CSS.
- Extend by wrapping in a higher-order header component that injects search or profile menus.
- Integrates with `ccmHero` and `ccmSection` so top-level pages share consistent structure.

## Demo
- `src/components/docs/demos/ccm-topbar-demo.vue` shows default and custom logo usage.
