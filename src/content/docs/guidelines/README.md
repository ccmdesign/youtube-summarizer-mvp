# Guidelines Documentation Templates

- Templates live under `src/content/docs/templates/guidelines/` (tokens, CUBE CSS, utilities) and provide scaffolding for major foundation doc types.
- AI-specific guidance now lives in `src/content/docs/guidelines/ai/` (start with `ai-maintenance.md`).
- Populate frontmatter with accurate `tokenSet`, `dataSource`, and legacy references before running foundations prompts.
- Place supporting imagery or diagrams in `assets/` and reference them with relative paths.
