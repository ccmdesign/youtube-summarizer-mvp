# AI Guidance Templates

- `_template.md` defines the structure for AI workflow docs that accompany prompts and automation.
- Update `audience`, `scope`, and `legacySource` to match the guidance being migrated.
- Capture guardrails and escalation steps so human reviewers can validate AI-assisted outputs.
