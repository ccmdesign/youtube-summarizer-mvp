## When to Use This Guide
- You are creating or evolving a component under `src/components/ds/`.
- You need a shared plan across engineering, design, documentation, and AI guidance.
- Pair this guide with `component-standards.md`, `implementation-playbook.md`, and `src/content/docs/guidelines/ai/components.md`.

## Lifecycle Overview
1. **Intake & triage**  
   - Capture the request in `_process/spec-drafts/` or the issue tracker.  
   - Audit existing DS components, wrappers (`src/components/`), and demos (`src/components/docs/demos/`) for reuse.
2. **Discovery & alignment**  
   - Partner with design, product, and accessibility stakeholders.  
   - Document requirements, required demos, and validation plan in the spec draft.
3. **Implementation**  
   - Build inside `src/components/ds/` following `component-standards.md`.  
   - Keep logic composable (`src/composables/`) and reusable across demos.
4. **Supporting assets**  
   - Update demos, docs, tests, and generated outputs in the same branch.  
   - Ensure AI mirrors receive updated guidance.
5. **Validation & QA**  
   - Run commands listed in `src/content/docs/guidelines/ai/validation.md` and capture manual QA notes.  
   - Do not skip accessibility checks.
6. **Release & communication**  
   - Version docs, announce changes, and provide migration guidance for downstream teams.
7. **Post-launch maintenance**  
   - Monitor adoption, triage bugs, and schedule follow-up work in `_process/spec-drafts/` or maintenance logs.

## Discovery & Scoping
**Stakeholder checklist**
- Design artefacts covering states (default, hover, focus, loading, disabled) and responsive behavior.
- Content guidance (copy length, localization, SEO requirements).
- Accessibility expectations (roles, aria attributes, keyboard flows).
- Token implications (new semantics, variable overrides, theming constraints).
- Analytics, telemetry, or tracking requirements.

**Scoping questions**
- Can an existing component or wrapper satisfy the need with configuration?  
- What is the minimal public API (props, slots, emits)?  
- Which demos (`src/components/docs/demos/`) must be updated or created?  
- What documentation or AI guidance changes are required?  
- Are new utilities, tokens, or tests needed?

Record answers in the spec. Link the spec in all PRs and docs updates.

## Implementation Requirements
- Author SFCs with `<script setup lang="ts">`, grouped props, and `defineOptions({ inheritAttrs: import.meta.env.PROD ? false : true })`.
- Keep styling limited to component-scoped CSS variables (`--_ccm-<component>-*`) and semantic tokens.  
- Move reusable logic into composables (`src/composables/`) when multiple components require it.
- Document props, slots, events, and examples with JSDoc so `scripts/generate-component-docs.ts` can emit the full payload.
- Wrap new features with stories/demos demonstrating all variants and accessibility states.

## Supporting Assets Matrix
| Asset | Path | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demo page | `src/components/docs/demos/ccm-<name>-demo.vue` | DS engineer + docs maintainer | Follow `demo-playbook`. Exercise variants, slots, and a11y toggles. Import `_docs/ccm-<name>.html?raw`. |
| Generated fragment | `src/components/docs/demos/_docs/ccm-<name>.html` | Automation | Regenerated with `npm run docs:components:generate`; never edit manually. |
| Component JSON | `public/component-docs/ccm<Name>.json` | Automation | Generated by `scripts/generate-component-docs.ts`; required for DocsTabs. |
| Markdown overview | `src/content/docs/components/ccm-<name>.md` (when present) | Docs maintainer | Keep metadata (status, changelog) aligned with generator output. |
| Tests | `src/tests/components/ds/ccm-<name>.spec.ts` | DS engineer | Cover props, slots, events, accessibility, and data transforms. |
| Release notes / ADR | `src/content/docs/guidelines/component-design-decisions.md` or `_process/spec-drafts/` | DS engineer | Log context and follow-up tasks. |

## Validation Pipeline
**Automated commands**
```bash
npx eslint src --ext .ts,.vue
npm run lint:css
npm run typecheck
npx vitest run src/tests/components/ds --run
npm run validate:tokens
npm run docs:components:generate
npm run build
```

**Manual QA**
- Load `/docs/demos/ccm-<name>-demo` and exercise every control path (keyboard + pointer).  
- Verify `/docs/<component>` renders tabs, demos, and metadata without console warnings.  
- Confirm responsive behavior at ≤768px, ≈1024px, and ≥1440px.  
- Capture accessibility notes (screen reader output, focus order, contrast).  
- Log skipped checks and create follow-up tickets when necessary.

## Release Management
- Bump version metadata in component docs or changelogs when public APIs change.  
- Document migration guidance (code snippets, prop changes, token adjustments).  
- Communicate releases to design, docs, QA, and downstream teams with links to demos and docs.  
- Update AI mirrors (`src/content/docs/guidelines/ai/*.md`) so automation inherits the new behavior immediately.

## Post-launch Responsibilities
- Track adoption, bug reports, and TODOs in `_process/spec-drafts/` or maintenance logs.  
- Schedule audits to consolidate variants or tokens that drift from design intent.  
- Use `src/content/docs/prompts/history.md` to record prompt-generated updates, noting manual edits when automation falls short.
