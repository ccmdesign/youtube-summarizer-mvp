  Setting Up Self-Improving Skills in Claude Code: Manual & Automatic Methods


  In this video, you'll learn how to set up self-improving skills within Claude
  Code. The tutorial addresses the key problem of Large Language Models (LLMs)
  not learning from previous interactions, causing repeated corrections in
  coding tasks. The solution involves creating a reflex skill that can analyze
  sessions, extract corrections, and update skill files. The video outlines both
  manual and automatic methods to implement these skills, leveraging Git version
  control for iterative improvements. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be
  able to continuously improve your coding harness, ensuring more efficient and
  less redundant coding sessions.
