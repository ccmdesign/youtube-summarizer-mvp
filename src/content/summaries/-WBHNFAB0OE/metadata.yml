title: AGENT THREADS. How to SHIP like Boris Cherny. Ralph Wiggnum in Claude Code.
description: >-
  How do you KNOW you're improving as an engineer in the age of AI? Thread Based
  Engineering is the answer.


  Even Andrej Karpathy feels left behind. If one of the greatest engineers of
  our generation struggles to keep up, what hope do the rest of us have? The
  answer is simpler than you think: MEASURE YOUR THREADS.

  🚀 In this video, we introduce thread based engineering, a powerful mental
  framework for understanding and improving your agentic coding abilities. A
  thread is a unit of engineering work over time driven by you and your agents.
  You show up at the beginning with the prompt and at the end with the review.
  Everything in between? That's your AI agents doing the heavy lifting through
  tool calls.


  🛠️ We break down SIX essential thread types for mastering agentic
  engineering:

  - Base Thread: Your fundamental unit of work

  - P Thread: Parallel execution for scaling output

  - C Thread: Chained work for production-sensitive tasks

  - F Thread: Fusion threads for rapid prototyping and confidence

  - B Thread: Meta structures with agents prompting agents

  - L Thread: Long duration, high autonomy workflows


  💡 Learn how Boris Cherny, creator of Claude Code, runs FIVE parallel Claude
  instances in his terminal and another 5-10 in the background. This is thread
  engineering in action. We also explore the Ralph Wiggum technique, showing how
  code plus agents outperforms agents alone.


  🔥 Four concrete ways to know you're improving:

  - Run MORE threads of work

  - Run LONGER threads with increased autonomy

  - Run THICKER threads with nested sub-agents

  - Run FEWER human-in-the-loop checkpoints


  🌟 Whether you're a senior engineer shipping to production with every prompt
  or just getting started with AI coding, understanding thread based engineering
  will transform your productivity. Master context engineering, prompt
  engineering, and principled AI coding to unlock the full potential of
  multi-agent workflows.


  💡 The future belongs to engineers who can scale their compute through
  parallel threads, fusion chains, and agentic prompt engineering. Don't get
  left behind in the agentic horizon. Start thinking in threads today.


  Stay focused and Keep Building.
