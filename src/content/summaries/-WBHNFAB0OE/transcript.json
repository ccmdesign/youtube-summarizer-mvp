  "fullText": "What's up engineers? Andy Devdan here. I have a simple trick question for you. How do you know you're improving from the vibe coder to the senior engineer shipping to production? With each prompt, how do you really know you're improving your ability to ship with agents? Even Andrew Carpathy, one of the greatest engineers of our generation, feels left behind. He says, \"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer.\" I think this speaks to a larger trend going on right now where we see a widening gap between engineers that are using agents and engineers that haven't been able to keep up. And with the creator of Claw Code himself sharing his individual setup, I thought this would be a great time to talk about a new mental framework I've been using for over 2 years that's helped me operationalize my agents so that I can continuously improve. One step is not enough. You need to be thinking about how to continuously day after day improve what you can do with agents because the ceiling keeps moving higher. This framework I'm going to share with you here strikes a common thread between everything happening right now in the age of agents from some of the best engineers feeling like they're falling behind which by the way Andrew Karpath is going to catch up with no problem. All the best engineers have one thing in common. They are self-aware. You can see he knows that this feels like a skill issue and he's 100% right about that. Agentic engineering is a new skill. New skills need new frameworks to measure progress against. This mental framework I'm going to share with you will tie together the Ralph Wickham technique with Boris Churnney setup and it'll give you a concrete road map for knowing for a fact that you're improving. If you don't measure it, you will not be able to improve it. So let me introduce you to threadbased engineering. So what do I mean when I say a thread? I'm talking about a unit of work over time driven by you and your agents. A thread has two mandatory nodes. You show up for the prompt or the plan and the review or the validation. Now, the middle piece here is your agent doing work. These are the individual tool calls that your agent makes. The beginning is you prompting or planning. The middle is your agent doing work. And the work here is the string of tool calls. And the end is you reviewing or validating. This should look very familiar. Every time you hit enter on a prompt in a tool with an agent, you are starting a thread of work. Let me be super concrete here. Every time you open a terminal and you fire up your agentic coding tool and you run a prompt, what is this codebase about? You are firing up a new thread of work. So, I've just ran the prompt and now my agent is doing its line of work. It's running a chain of tool calls. In this case, it's firing off a sub agent to accomplish work. But you can see there are all the tool calls running. When this completes, I'm going to have to review the work. So, you and I show up at the beginning and the end. So, 10 tools, 21K tokens. Now it's going to give us a summary and this is us reviewing the work. This line of work, this thread has now completed. This is what I mean when I'm talking about threads of work. So why do we care about the base thread? It's because this gives you everything you need to know to improve. And the key insight here is the fact that you can measure the value your agents creating in tool calls. Tool calls roughly equal impact assuming you're prompting something useful. Now pre2023 you and I were the tool calls. We were updating the code. We were reading. We were doing the web requests. We were doing all of that. But everything has changed. Now we show up at the beginning with the prompt and the end with the review. The base thread represents a unit of engineering work over time driven by you and your agent. Now the base thread itself isn't that interesting, but everything we do from here builds on that. Because after you have one thread, guess what you can do? Yes. Scale it. parallel execution. You can set up multiple threads of work running simultaneously in your terminal, in your git work tree, in your sandbox. And normally these will be spread across time. You can kick your prompts off in sync together like this, but oftent times you'll be firing off a new terminal or work tree or some process, right? some cloud out of the loop agent decoding tool across time because you can't really review or prompt everything at the same time. There's always a little shift over time. So here's a prompt. Once that line of work gets going, you can write another prompt. Once that line of work gets going, you're freed up to write another prompt or plan and then you eventually review. And we can concretely see this from an engineer like Boris Churnney, the creator of Claw Code. How does this tie into everything happening right now in the industry? Everyone is running threads of work. Boris has this great tweet here. He's talking about his vanilla setup of cloud code. It's relatively simple, but you can see here he is running the P thread parallel threads. All right, he runs five clawed codes in his terminal and he numbers his tabs one through five. So out of the gate, Boris Churnney expects to run multiple agents. It's not even a question. He just defaults to running five agents in parallel. Guess who's getting more done? The engineer kicking off a single agent in one terminal or five agents in five separate terminals. This is the Pthread in action. Now, if we scroll down even further, he mentions this as well. He also runs five to 10 additional cloud codes in the Cloud Code web interface. All right, so he's got background clouds running and he kicks them off using the at symbol you can run in Cloud Code to kick off sessions in Chrome that he teleports back and forth. This is very cool. And once again, he's keeping track of multiple threads of work. So this is very powerful. After you have a single line of work running, you can then kick off additional lines of work, right? Units of work. You can kick off additional threads. I do this so often that I have tools like the fork terminal skill that I can use to kick off brand new terminals and kind of branch out. And I also have tools like this pthread review the Ralph Wiggum implementation in apps/star. And I want to run four of these. All right. So I'm going to fork my terminal and I'm going to kick off a brand new process. I have Pthread alias. And so what I'm going to do here is kick off multiple threads of work with a single prompt. All right. So check this out. I forked a terminal and it's created four instances of this Asian. I'm using a few different tools and a few different skills combined here, but the idea is simple. I can have my agents and I can run commands that spin up additional agents. So, what I'm doing here is I have four agents running in parallel with that same prompt. They're all figuring out what this codebase does. And if we scroll up here, you can see these are all individual instances review the Ralph Wickham implementation in apps. So, I have four agents, right? I just spun up 4x the compute that a normal engineer would by parallelizing. All right, so this is the P thread and this allows me to tap into more compute. This is ultra useful for things like reviewing. In addition to the way that Boris uses cloud code, where you are spinning up one to 10 parallel cloud codes to accomplish individual units of work, you can also spin up agents to run the exact same prompt to get more confidence in their responses. For example, one of my favorite ways to use a tool like this is to run codebased review. Repeat threads let you scale your engineering output through parallelism. This is one concrete way to know that you're improving. Can you spin up more threads of work where you are prompting and then reviewing after your agent has accomplished the work? If you have to sit and babysit a single agent, you probably need to scale down your threads and just work on a single thread of work. So, this is just two of six threads we're going to talk about in this video. We're going to work through these to showcase how you can think about engineering with agents and improving what you can do. And there's a common thread. There's there's a common idea among all of these, right? Ultimately, what we're doing here is increasing the total tool calls your agents are making on your behalf. So, we've covered the base thread and the P thread, the two most common types of threads, the two most common lines of work you can do with your agents. We're going to cover C, FB, and L threads right now. And to be super clear, we're not talking about traditional, you know, CPU process threading. These are lines of work that you and your agent accomplish where you show up at the beginning for the prompt or the plan and then the ending for the review and the validation. All right, this is a new way you can think about engineering with agents. What if you have a massive multi-phase plan? You can use a Cthread. The C thread is perfect for this. This is a chained thread. You can chain together work into phases. Now, these checkpoints aren't because your agent has messed up. That's not what a chain thread is. That's bad agent coding. All right. What I'm talking about here is intentionally chunking your work. Why would you use a Cthread? There are two main reasons. Maybe the work can't fit in a single agent's context window. Or maybe you're doing high pressure production work and you want to chunk it down to make sure every single step is right. This is the tool you can pull out of your pocket when you have a large chunk of work that needs to be broken down into smaller pieces. Say you have a 50-step plan that is very sensitive and if one thing goes wrong, things will crash in production. Say you're doing like a migration or something, right? Some type of high-risk production level work. You can run in chunks. So you can plan and review one chunk of work and then after you review you can continue the next phase of work with that agent or another agent and then you can continue to phase three. So this is a great way to chunk up work. Cloud code has the ask user question tool where your agent can stop midworkflow and ask you a question. This is great for Cthreads. You can also just use the system notification and this is something that Boris does. He mentions the system notification when cloud code needs input. So when it's finished its chunk of work that it just did, you can have your agent use natural language to communicate to you that it's finished work. I have a text to speech hook that runs in some of my code bases that will have my agent summarize the work and then spit it back to me in natural language. It's super useful for hopping back in the loop for that next phase of work. So Cthreads are very powerful for this reason. It's great for production sensitive work. Of course, on the channel, we always talk about increasing the trust you have with your agent so that you need fewer human in the loop review steps. But still, we have to be realistic. There's a lot of production work that we want to decompose down into single steps so that we increase our trust in the work that was done. All right? And the trade-off here is your time and energy. The Cthread is the first thread where you really want to question yourself before you use this. Do you need to break this work down into phases? If you do, C threads are great. If you don't, just use a base thread. Let's move on to the F thread. This is by far my favorite type of thread. All right, this is the fusion thread. This is also known as a fusion chain. We've talked about this pattern for over two years now on the channel, and it's never been more relevant. The idea is simple. You send the same prompt or a similar prompt to multiple agents. You then review all the results and then you combine them. You aggregate them. You fuse them. And in previous videos, we've talked about the best of end pattern where you spin up multiple agents and then choose the best. This is that pattern exactly with entire lines of agent work. All right. So now, not only are we parallelizing, we're spinning up more agents using more compute and then taking the result we like the best and then combining it. And you can aggregate any way you want, right? It's not always best of end. Sometimes you want to cherrypick ideas and results from many different agents to get a superior result. Again, I use this all the time with my Pthread tool. If we open up a terminal and then we can prompt something like this. I have this queued up already for us. So, I'll just paste the send. Use Pthread with three CC3 gem three codecs and then use this prompt. Exactly. We're firing up multiple agents inside of a single workload. We're parallelizing a result. And this is one of my favorite ways to use agents. By the way, I'm doing rapid prototyping all the time now. And my Pthread skill, my paralleliz skill helps me do this. Now, the fusion thread starts out as a P thread and then you combine the results, right? You choose the best event or you aggregate or you merge the result, right? You fuse them and then you have your final result at the end. And so what's going to happen here is my agent is going to kick off nine agents in parallel, three running cloud code, three running Gemini, three running codecs. And you can see here uh with this great MROS tool. I'll link it in the description for you. I've kicked off multiple agents and they're all going to spin up their own agent sandbox. We've talked about agent sandboxes in the past on the channel. I'll go ahead and link those as well if you're interested. Um agent sandboxes are great because you can defer trust with your agents. This is the pattern for rapid prototyping, running many versions, right? For looking into the future with multiple branches of what a solution could look like. Again, this is my favorite thread by far just because you can do so much. You can experiment so much and so fast by deploying more compute. So anyway, so these agents are going to spin. This is a P thread I've spun up, right? So I have multiple lines of work running. I have nine lines of work technically running right now. And when they finish, we're going to synthesize them, combine them, choose the best, and then when it comes to agent sandboxes, we would pull down maybe one or two versions, and then combine them to select the result we're looking for. The key insight here is simple with the fusion thread. The chances you'll have a successful agent complete the work go up when you have more agents trying to complete the work, right? Just take more shots at the problem. Fusion threads scale through consolidation. And the idea is so simple. Here we're using more compute to gain more confidence. If you ask one agent a question, it'll say something back. If you ask five, you'll get a much higher confidence in the answers that were returned. Say four out of five of them gave you the exact same answer. you can be more confident in that answer. Research agents use fusion threads pretty often. You know, using sub aents or, you know, spinning up multiple versions to do multiple web searches. That's the kind of most blatant example out there. But there are many other ways to use the fusion thread. This is where we start stepping into advanced agentic engineering territory. Most engineers haven't used a fusion thread outside of spinning up multiple sub aents, which is absolutely an example of a fusion thread. The big difference there is your primary agent is fusing the results for you. So you need to be clear about how that work occurs. The fusion thread is the cream of crop for rapid prototyping. And I'm just going to go ahead and say this. The future of rapid prototyping will be done with fusion threads. You can mark my words on that. I'm betting big on this trend. This is the F thread. Now things start to get interesting. Now we can start scaling and getting kind of meta with our threads. All right. Everything in engineering eventually recurses back on itself. You build the thing with the smaller pieces of the thing. Bthreads, also just known as a big thread, is a meta structure. Now your prompts are firing off other prompts. So the clearest example of this is firing off sub aents. When your agent prompts other agents, those sub aents can do more specific well-defined work for you. The simplest example of this is the plan build workflow where you have one agent plan and the other build. The great thing is here with the Bthread is from your perspective as the engineer you're just running a prompt and you're reviewing it at the end. Of course you will agent engineer all the stuff that happens on the inside whether you're running a base thread a P thread C thread F thread whatever you're doing inside of your big thread that is all hidden from you. It's a black box. You don't care because you've engineered it the right way and it's just going to run that way. So the whole idea here with the B thread is by deploying more compute here you create a thicker thread. You can run more threads, you can fuse your threads and you can create thicker threads. More stuff happens here within a specific unit of time when you deploy the right subthreads. All right, so this is the meta structure. The big thread contains threads. The key pattern here is that you have an agent that is writing prompts for you. The first version of this showcased by claw code is the sub aent. When you prompt your primary agent to run sub agents, it is prompting the sub agents. Now on the channel, we've also looked at the orchestrator agent, which is the next higher level up to this where you have a orchestrator agent kicking off primary agents. There's a lot more you can do there, but you know, imagine a team, right? Your orchestrator agent can kick off a team, a plan agent, a scout agent, then a build agent, then multiple review agents, then finally a, you know, pre-eploy staging agent. Then you come in at that last step for the review and then you kick it off, right? That's the B thread. A bunch of stuff, other threads of work happen inside, but you don't care about them. That's where your B thread to manage. From your perspective, you kicked off one thread with a prompt and then you reviewed it at the end. You showed up at the beginning and the end under the hood. Your system of agents or your teams of agents orchestrated running a base P or of course another Bthread underneath. All right, Bthreads are really important and very powerful because they start pushing you into not just running agents, right? They start pushing you into this idea of combining code plus agents to get outsiz return on your time and your effort. All right? And a pattern that does exactly that is starting to emerge. We now have this Ralph Wiggum pattern which is effectively AI engineers are starting to figure out that agents plus code outperforms agents alone. Right? Ralph welcome is literally a loop over an agent to accomplish specific work. I'm being a little bit reductive there, but that is the idea. We've talked about this idea for over a year now. This is in both courses, principal AI coding and tactical agent coding. We know this as AI developer workflows, ADWs, but it is great to see a pattern like this really hitting the mainstream. Big shout out to Jeff Huntley for bringing this idea to the masses and really scaling it. That's the B thread. Now, speaking of Ralph, there is one more thread that ties it all together. So, how do you get thicker threads? You build teams of agents. You build workflows, right? You build agentic workflows. You build prompts that call other agents. You build sub agents, custom agents. Ultimately here, what we're doing is you're specializing your agents. You teach your primary agent how to use the right tools. And then they do it end to end. Now this brings us full circle to the L thread. So the L thread is high autonomy endtoend long duration work. All right, extended agent autonomy without human intervention. You can have a huge huge prompt that runs and it can be hundreds and hundreds of steps long. It could run for hours. You've seen Boris and other engineers run prompts for hours and hours. Some, you know, over a day long. And I think he had a post down here somewhere showcasing one of his long duration runs. Yeah. 1 day, 2 hours. Very, very impressive longunning L thread. And he even mentions the Ralph Wickham plugin here. But the idea is all the same. Scratch all the, you know, fancy prompting threading work from all of our previous steps. Just write a clearer, better prompt with the right tooling that lets your agent run longer, high autonomy, massively long duration workflows, calling many, many, many tools. We're talking hundreds and thousands of tool calls. And this is the Lthread. Now, notice what this looks like. The Lthread comes full circle right back to our base thread. Same shape, just longer, more tool calls. That means more autonomy. Nothing fancy going on here, right? We're getting better at prompting. We have better models. or manage our context better and our tools help drive that effort forward. Once again, I'm referencing the core four context model prompt tools. If you understand the core four, you understand agents and therefore agentic engineering. Everything comes back to this. The engineer running longer threads of useful work is outperforming the others. There's a ton of untapped potential in figuring out how to kick off agents to run longer. This is where great planning pays off because great planning is great prompting. And this is of course why Ralph Wiggum is gaining so much traction right now because engineers are realizing that if you can have your agent keep running against the problem you want to solve, it will run longer chains of work with more autonomy. Right? Even if we are kind of conducting the autonomy with something like the stop hook. Now I want to give the stop hook a little attention here because I think Ralph Wickham again great idea Boris mentions this as well right stop hook for very longunning tasks the L thread I will either prompt claw to verify its work with a background agent so here this is in fact a C ththread after it finishes it work he's going to run another agent to verify its work okay so he's chaining together multiple calls to make sure the work is done or he uses the agent stop hook all right so this is super interesting the agent stop hook is something we're going to be talking about more on the channel. I didn't want to put it in this video, but I wanted to briefly kind of showcase the workflow. Your agent tries to stop, the stop hook runs, and then there's some decision code that you run. This is the deterministic code. The stop hook can intercept, it can run some code, it can check a progress file, it can run a validation command, and then it can continue the workflow where you reloop over again or it completes the work. All right, so the stop hook is super important. It allows you to tap into that deterministic traditional code plus agents. Again, if you're inside of tactical agent decoding, you've already seen this. You're already working with this. We call these ADWs there. All right. The stop hook lets you tap into that inside of the claw code ecosystem. Very powerful. What do all of these techniques give us? Thread-based engineering is a way to think about operating with agents. You show up at the prompt and the review, but this means that there is a huge intermediate stretch of time where your agent is doing the work. This gives you the opportunity to spin up additional threads of work in different shapes and connect them in different ways. So, we have six threads here. These are the most common that I've seen and the most important for quickly getting results out of your agents and for knowing that you're improving. So, let's dive into that more. Right, we kicked this all off. We started this video by asking, how do you know you're improving? You can think of improving in terms of your total threads, the length of your threads, the size of your threads, ultimately boiling down to one thing. The number of tool calls you're running with your agent. There are four concrete ways to improve with the threadbased engineering framework in mind. You can run more threads, you can run longer threads, you can run thicker threads, and you can run fewer human in the loop checkpoints. All right, when you do this, you're increasing the trust you have in your system. So these are the four ways you can improve when you're thinking about engineering with agents, right? When you're thinking about agentic engineering, more threads, longer threads, thicker threads, or fewer checkpoints. And you can see this, you know, for me, Boris's post here is so valuable because it showcases how he's doing more with his threads of work. He's got five clouds in parallel in the terminal. Fantastic. And then he puts them on the background, probably short, medium to long running threads, but he's scaling up even further. Right? If we hop back to parallel, right, our P threads, he's got multiple threads running. He's got 10 threads running at most based on his post. So very very powerful, very cool. There are a couple other mentionables here. He always uses Opus 4.5. Makes sense. Claude in the repo, but they don't let it get too large. That's great, right? He's got inloop agent decoding inside of his terminal, and he's got outloop agent decoding with the cloud code web interface, so he can step away. Let's see. Anything else here? Interesting. He does not use dangerously skip. He sets up specific permissions. I think this makes sense if you're working in a single codebase for the most of your work. But you can see all in all he's got multiple threads running of work, specifically parallel threads, right? And then his final tip here is the most important thing to get great results out of cloud code, give it a way to verify its work. Essentially creating a validation loop or a closed loop system, right? A feedback loop so that your agent can resolve its own work. And this speaks to both the strengths and the weaknesses of the Cthread. You don't really want to be hopping in the loop. In fact, this is one of the four ways you can improve. reduce the number of times you have to review your agent's work. Again, there's some critical scenarios where you do want to step in the loop and make sure that your agent has done the right thing, but as much as you can give your agents the tools to validate their own work. All right, so again, four ways to improve your engineering. Run more threads, run longer threads, run thicker threads, and run fewer human in the loop checkpoints. I know this is a little high level. It's a little void of details of how you run more, longer, thicker, or fewer, but the ideas are there. Spin up more terminal windows. Make sure you have inloop agent decoding tools and outloop agent coding tools. Of course, Boris uses cloud code and the cloud code web interface. You can use whatever you want. I always recommend, you know, for your production assets, you build your own net new agentic layer around your codebase. That's one of the critical topics inside of tactical agentic coding. Why do I say that? It's because you want a specialized set of agents operating your specialized codebase built to solve a specific problem. So these are four ways you can improve your agentic engineering by looking at everything you do as threads of work. And so I want to share just one last thread here, kind of a teaser thread for you. What happens when your agentic engineering evolves to such a high level that you're able to push your agents far and they're reviewing all their work and they're accomplishing tons and tons for you. What is the future of engineering? Right? What happens when you increase your trust with your agent to the max? You blow away the review step. All right? There is a hidden seventh thread. I call it the Zthread. This is the zero touch thread. All right? This is the maximum trust you have with your agents. I've teased this in the singularity video we put out last week or a couple weeks ago and this is a big idea of where engineering is going. I'm not going to talk about this one too much because it's one of the big ideas we talk about in tactical agent coding near the ending advanced lessons and a lot of engineers just don't believe that this is possible and I don't want to confuse any engineers especially newer engineers in thinking that this is vibe coding this is not vibe coding this is very very high level very advanced agentic coding this is maximum trust it isn't that we don't look at the code it's that we know we don't have to that's the endgame let's come full circle here how can great engineers like Andrew Carpathy keep up in the age of agents that we live in. You can think of all of your work in threads. A thread is a unit of engineering work over time conducted by you and your agents. You prompt and plan in the beginning and then you review and validate when your agent has finished. In the middle, your agent is doing the work through tool calls. This is threadbased engineering. So, how do you know you're improving? You know you're improving because you can do one of the following. You can add threads. You can run longer threads. You can combine the results of different threads of work. And then you can compose threads together so that you show up at the prompt and review step while additional threads run in between your agents work. So your agents are firing off other agents to complete and chain together work. And then in the end you just run longer threads. You do this by learning great agentic prompt engineering and great context engineering. In the end, remember that everything boils down to just four pieces. The core four, context, model, prompt, and tools. You can use these six threads as a foundation for you. But the core idea is to remember if you want to improve, you're running more threads, you're running longer threads, you're running thicker threads with nested threads underneath, and you're running fewer human in the loop checkpoints, right? because you've built systems that you trust, because you're using better models, better tools, better context, and you're writing better prompts. All right, the most important thing to remember, too, is that agentic engineering or engineering with agents is a new skill. At first, you'll be running short threads of work with one agent in the terminal. Then, before you know it, you'll be more like Boris, running five agents in the terminal and five more out the loop in the cloud somewhere. You'll add more threads. You'll make them thicker and then you'll make them run for longer. Then once you've pushed to the edge of agentic engineering, you'll access the final thread level, the Zthread. This represents the northstar of the big ideas we talk about in tactical agentic coding. I'll leave a link for that in the description for you if you're interested. But in the end, we're running Zthreads, zero touch threads. There's no more review node. This is what you want to be pushing toward. This is what I and other top engineers are pushing toward. I don't want to have to review my agents work. I want to be able to push past that, scale past that. All right? I want to accomplish the mission of this channel, which is to build living software that works for us while we sleep. That's been the mission for years. That hasn't changed, and we're going to work toward that every week here, every single Monday. This is the future of engineering. So, start pushing toward it. Don't be afraid of it. Don't run away from it. Software engineering has changed again and again and it will continue to. But by thinking in threads, you can know that you're improving because you're giving more work to your agents and you're showing up where it matters most, the planning and the reviewing. If you want to scale your impact, you must scale your compute. If you want to push what you can do further and fast track your journey into this new role of Agentic Engineering, check out Tactical Agentic Coding, link in the description. As always, I'll see you next Monday. Stay focused and keep building.",
