title: I Ran Whisper 100% Offline… Here’s What Actually Happened
description: >-
  Transcribing audio offline without sending your data to the cloud is harder
  than it should be. Most tools are slow, expensive, or require uploading
  private audio to third-party services.


  In this video, I test Buzz, a free, open-source desktop app powered by
  OpenAI’s Whisper model, that lets you transcribe and translate audio 100%
  locally on your own machine. No cloud, no API keys, no subscriptions.
