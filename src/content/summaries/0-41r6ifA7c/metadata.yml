title: Enrico Tartarotti - How did one person design and build all of this?
description: >-
  Today's episode goes deep into all of the design details in a new video
  collaboration tool called Flask (https://flask.do/) .


  But the reason I’m so inspired by this product goes far beyond the UI/UX…


  Flask is designed and built by one person— Enrico Tartarotti
  (https://x.com/EnriTarta) —who was a PM before this so his journey is the
  perfect example of what it looks like to thrive as a generalist builder.


  So this episode tells the story of what it took to build a well-crafted
  product and all of the lessons that he learned along the way.


  Enrico references the Mom Test (https://www.momtestbook.com/) for user
  research and the episode with the Supercut Founders
  (https://www.dive.club/deep-dives/supercut) .
