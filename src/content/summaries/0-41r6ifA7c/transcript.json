  "fullText": "Let's say that I started this like five years ago. I would have raised some money like hire 10 people and we do all like designs and then refine like the whole loop it's much slower. With AI the speed of this process can be 10xed essentially right for this stage where I'm at. This is kind of the superpower that I have versus all my competitors. Welcome to Dive Club. My name is Rid and this is where designers never stop learning. This week's episode is a deep dive into a new video collaboration tool called Flask. [music] But it's not just about the design details. The reason I find this product so inspiring is that it was designed and built by one person, Enrico Tartarati. But what's really special is this dude was a PM before he started working on this. So it's the perfect example of what it looks like to thrive as a generalist builder. Today we're going to go deep into everything that it took to design and build a well-crafted product and all of the lessons that Enrico has learned along the way. So let's dive right into what he made. [music] The core idea of Flask is that creativity cannot be conveyed in a text box. That's the core idea of it. So let me open a random video that uh we have. So it supports both YouTube videos and regular videos that you can upload. So the core idea of this is that of course just like any other collaboration tool where we are working together to make a video like me and my team or I need to show it to someone else we want to comment on it. We want to say oh this piece sucks this piece is good. What I was finding myself doing was writing gigantic walls of text trying to explain this and that with words but it just doesn't work. Imagine trying to convey to someone take this mouse. >> Like imagine trying to describe this mouse to someone just with words. It doesn't work like they would understand. With creativity, you need references. You need to explain complex ideas. So the idea with Flassy that sure you can leave your comment. But then you can also go ahead and hit record and 3 2 1 and now I'm recording myself. So I can explain to someone a complex idea. So for example here in the intro I want to make it I don't know a tiny bit faster and reduce the chromatic aberation on the sides. So I hit enter and flask is going to automatically capture all the insights from there and the recording is going to be available right here in the comment. [music] Real quick message and then we can jump back into it. If you're like me then you know adding motion to your designs is the easiest way to make them feel premium. The thing is, I'm not a motion designer. But that's why Jitter's new AI brainstorm feature is a gamecher. [music] I just drop in my design and then get instant motion ideas that I can tweak, refine, and make my own. It's seriously so easy to animate your work with Jitter. I cannot recommend it enough. [music] Just head to dive.com/jitter to try it out today. I saw a scroll stopping tweet the other day. The creators of Tailwind are working directly on paper [music] to train the output to be perfect. They even invested in the company. So just think about the possibilities for a second. In the future, [music] you could design something in paper and then just write click and copy the perfect Tailwind as if the creators themselves wrote it by hand. Or maybe you take an existing code component and import it into paper to make edits [music] directly on the canvas. I mean, this is going to totally change how we design and deliver UIs for the web. And it's just another reason why I'm betting big on paper as the next [music] great design tool. You can try it out today. Just head to dive.club/paper. [music] Okay, now on to the episode. The thing that I find so interesting about you and this product [music] is you're a solo builder with a product background. You've never actually been a professional designer, right? And yet like this thing looks really good. So can you give us just a quick crash course of your background? But what I'm really interested in digging into is how the heck did you develop this level of taste and refine your visual skills to the point where you're able to do the full end to end design for something like this? >> Well, I've always been, you know, that guy growing up like always with computers and programming like a lot of the people I guess uh following this podcast. So I I I know how to code from a young age. I I've never been trained as a like a software engineer to be honest. It's just like I'm I'm I'm passionate about technology. Uh I worked as a product manager at Amazon and at Maze. Maze is one of the biggest uh user research tools out there. I left that job last year. Since then and on the side of this on over the past 5 years, I've uh also been running my YouTube channel where I talk about the design engineering and psychology behind the tech that we use every day. So I would say that the design piece comes from first of all being always into digital media some way. Like when I was 15 I was doing I don't know after effects you know VFX shots like with me with my scrappy camera and trying to do like gunshots and stuff. So a lot of these things kind of translate over. So, for example, knowing how to edit videos or how to do thumbnails with Photoshop, even though it's not the same as uh you know, designing an interface from like a tool level or a pixel level, the the core taste that you acquire into something, it's kind of the same. A friend of mine is an Italian designer. I took his course. So, but it was very hands-on. So, there's not a lot of design theory, empathy, a lot of none of that. It's more like, okay, how do you actually, you know, center things, organize things? what is the spacing between this and that? You start to get a feel for things. To be honest, the biggest learning experience has been just building it. Building it and being exposed to the best in the field like being exposed to top level god tier products when it comes to design. Uh like for example in May I I visited notion's headquarters. I made a video there talking with the designers and the engineers and it was so cool to go behind the scenes of all the little details and the level of you know obsession that they go for every detail. So you kind of absorb some of that. You use a new tool like I'm friends with David from Supercut. You had it on the podcast as well. >> And you use a tool. You're like, \"Oh, this feels good. Let me actually zoom in to the every like menu and things and understand why like why do they do this uh in one way or the other?\" And then you're thinking, \"Okay, like actually my thing kind of sucks now that I see this. So let me go and fix it.\" So this is >> I've been in the place before with Supercut. >> Yeah. Yeah. So like you ship your thing and you're happy with it and then you you discover things that are at a higher level and then you slowly build up like that. You know I think it's again going back to to to things coming from different angles like with YouTube is kind of the same. you know, your first video, you're excited, you're like, \"Oh my god, this is great. It's going to be an amazing million views.\" And now if I look back at it, it was horrible. But then I'm like, \"Okay, at the moment I was so proud and then I watch something else like I can I I can integrate something from that or the intro from that other person or that angle from whatever.\" And then slowly you kind of build it up. The thing now is that with AI and you know with the speed at which you can build the speed of this process can be 10xed essentially, right? So if in the past let's say that I was I don't know in a startup that I that I I started this like 5 years ago I would have raised some money like hire 10 people and we do all like designs and then refine like the whole loop is much uh it's much slower and right now I just was able to iterate much faster and again if I see someone that has like a cool idea for how to do like menus or drop downs or whatever in a day it can be out and I'm like okay now this looks better this feels better being that I'm not this gigantic company. I don't have all the baggage of oh like how are the legacy customer going to feel about it? I don't care. I'm just going to release it and you know [laughter] see see how it is. It's not it's not going to this is not sustainable of course for um when you have like a $100 million a year business. But for this stage where I'm at, this is kind of the superpower that I have versus all my competitors that that are these kind of huge companies. I've shipped a lot of things over the months that turned out to be something that people were like confused about. And so, okay, I just rolled back the change. The fact that you have such an active early community is also useful because you get immediate feedback like, hey, this is stupid. Okay, oh, sorry. I I'll roll it back and find a better way to do it. >> Your point about the speed of development with AI is so interesting for someone in your position where you're sweating a lot of these like interface details kind of for the first time or at least the first time where you've been responsible for all of them. advice I've given to younger designers in years past is like you just got to get through your first 5, 10, 100 designs because they're undeniably going to suck. Like you just have to get through the suck in order to get to the point where you actually are making something of high quality. And I think that's what's so fascinating to me looking at your work is just the trajectory and the rate at which you've been able to get to something for the first time that is really high quality is is truly impressive. And one of the things that you mentioned to me off the record was how David at Supercut did a little critique of your work and kind of just went through the product one time. And I'm wondering if from his feedback you're able to identify specific ways that you've evolved the lens that you use to evaluate what you're making and maybe even other products too. >> Yeah, I think I mean that was a fun story. There's like four I think four employees a supercar or something like that. And one of them is one of the my engineers that was working with me at Maze in my team. We just randomly stumbled across each other with in this co-working in Barcelona. And so then for the month I was there I also got to meet like them and David and we got start to talk. So then we were like uh I was about to launch the first version like the public launch in October and I asked them we did a bit of a trading of skills like me for like more YouTube production and content for them and then David took a look I think he's he's amazing like he's a he's a way better designer and then visual like in all aspects than me and so he took a look at the product and he's like okay it looks cool but it it looked like a toy. So I was like you you can still kind of feel and see that it has a bit of this, you know, 3D type of effect where, for example, like the top of each border radius is a bit lighter. So it gives like this light from the top type of effect. But it was way more exaggerated in that first version. Looking at it now, I can see that it was a bit tacky, a bit too much. And he's like, \"Okay, it's I get what you're trying to do here, but it cannot feel too much like a toy. It needs to be like it's a product that people will use.\" So we actually sat down and we we started t typing tailwind classes into it. The thing about taking this kind of feedback is to be able to technically go ahead and understand what the feedback is and how to fix it. We started literally talking about which tailwind classes to add or remove to the CSS of the components to make it look more and that's what you see now like I have a tailwind class that creates this kind of 3D effect in the subtle way that I want everywhere. So it's like centralized but now my taste has evolved based on that learning. So now if I I could never recreate something as bold, let's call it tacky in the way that I that I did in the first version because I would be my own judge of that. I think going getting your work out there to the user. A user is never going to say oh like your border radius on the top is is off like they don't know about that. >> So I think it's useful to yes get it out to users and see like if they actually use it if there's retention and like does it make sense for the business. Does the pricing make sense? Is the information architecture correct? Like do people understand what the product does? And that's one type of feedback. But then also trying to get feedback from the closest person that you have access to. Of course, like depending on your level, you might be having access to different kind of network, but that can maybe they're one step ahead of you that can give you some feedback about like, hey, like don't mind about how you use it. Just roast it. Like please, I told you like David, please roast it. Don't hold back. Just tell me anything that you see that is wrong that is like even small details. I I want to get a ton of work from this to do and fix. So I think you need both and um that's that's the way to grow yourself as well. You know, >> you mentioned the tailwind classes. Having used the product, I can notice, okay, you have these kind of consistent borders. There's a consistent gradient on the hover states for certain buttons. How far have you went into the systematizing things direction as a solo builder? Like where do you think that line is? >> I tried to do the minimum possible so that things look generally okay. So, for example, I don't know the the J and L keys here, they don't have any spacing between them. There's a bunch of details in in their UI that are not to the level. And to be to be honest, this probably I mean, I don't I'm not sure if this is a full like perfect circle, this icon. I need to check. But you see that I'm not trying to go like pixel peeping on everything. I choose I pick my battles. That's the thing. And for whatever else where I don't pick my battles, I try to systematize. So for example, up until last week, this was a uh its own kind of menu with its own styling. And now I created a generic styling for all menus like this is shed CI and I just created like um I customized the the classes. So for example, if I do this and you see that it has this kind of translucent effect and the hover state and I just say, okay, I just literally tell Claude, okay, take this menu that we built manually like maybe two months ago and just now we're going to use this standard default component from Chassien just adapt it and there we go. So now this is literally the same or if I do this then again this is literally the same menu. Uh and most of the time you don't need to do any tweaks. So, I pick my battles. Like, for example, here on this part, the comments box, this is where I would spend hours and hours pixel peeping. And like, for example, >> I can tell for what it's worth. It's nice. >> There's a little springy animation and it's been tweaked and it's nice. And this is because this is the components that 80% of the people are going to actually use and interact the most with. So, yeah. Okay. Like the the chevron rotates. Like I don't think all the other chevron rotates, but this one does. And is it consistent? Maybe at the moment, no. But here it's important that it's nice. Uh or this turns into an ax to close it. Would I do this on every plus button in the app? Probably not. And I don't have like a generic component. I just try to pick my battles and then systematize when you can. Like for example, I have two types of buttons. Uh let me see. So this is a secondary button with this kind of gradient hover effect and it's uh there's like a also like when you hold it down it moves and translates to to the bottom. Uh and there's like a primary button as well which is this and you'll see it all the way in the UI. So I mean doesn't take long to create those. I'm probably going to use a lot of primary and secondary buttons. So makes sense to to do it. But then other than that, I have a a tailwind class for this kind of 3D border effect which I might use on things that are not a comment or maybe it's a button or maybe it's something else here and there like uh here it's used for this uh indicator of time stamp. And it's just easy for me to have a few things here and there that are standardized but not be too locked to a perfect system. Also because again because your taste is going to evolve and the app is going to evolve. You don't want to lock yourself into too too much of a rigid system when it comes to when it comes to things because now you have AI. It's not about oh I need to manually update the same thing in 10 places. You can just ask the AI hey find all the instances of this and just change it. So I think there also less of a need of like a super duper standardized design system. But at the same time the right little pieces of consistency help create a standard, you know, look and feel to the app. [music] I've been designing products every day for the last 15 years. But in the last 6 months, everything [music] has changed. With AI in the mix, I'm cranking out ideas faster than ever. But none of that matters if I can't get the feedback that I need to get the team aligned. [music] And right now, getting async feedback still kind of sucks. So, I'm building the product I've always wanted, and it's called Inflight. I use it every day to share ideas and get feedback from the team. And it's totally changing the way that I work. So, I'm [music] excited to show you. Right now, I'm only giving access to DiveClub listeners. So, [music] head to dive.comclub/inflight to claim your spot. Can we look at the timeline component? I can already tell that there's like a ton of little interactions and minuscule design details in there. Can you talk about some of the decisions that you've made, some of the intentional ways that you've iterated? I'd love to kind of just use that as an excuse to go through. >> This is the timeline. you might need a client or someone that's not familiar with video to use it. But at the same time, you also might have like an editing video professional use it. So you you want to have something that is powerful but that you discover how it works because it's slightly different that than like a standard video player that you discover progressively and it makes sense. So for me like okay if I start to create a comment here let's say Enrico or like make this slower then the comment is going to appear there visual straightforward I understand what's going on right uh if I add another comment here let's say that it's like here and this is important and this is I don't know uh an audio recording of some of some kind uh where I might say so here for example we want to make it a match cut. Cool. So now I have an audio recording here. I can say uh this is important. And there we go. I started to to create some comments and um and to add to my to my timeline. But what happens now is that if I go here and create something, then you can already see that there is no space. So what's going to happen? Let's see. I just create it. And now you see that oh things have changed. It has zoomed automatically. Mhm. >> There's an animation. I don't need like a tutorial to tell me, oh, this is a zoomable thing. I I it just zoomed. It must be zoomable. That's why there is this plus. And this these controls are not important because people are going to use them. These are here just because to tell you that hey, this is something zoomable. >> So most people are not not going to interact with these. It's more like, oh, actually, if there's uh this and this and this, oh, probably there's some kind of zooming going on here, right? So, of course, you can use them, but you can use your mouse or your trackpad and you can zoom in and out. I'm with the mouse right now, but you can see that. Okay, now it's zoomed and so I can pan, I can move around and now I can understand like, oh, now I understand what happened, right? >> Yeah, the Figma style clustering is nice too like there's so many little things happening in here. The challenge with this was basically this is one of the the few let's call an innovations of this which is all the competitor have like player play bar list of comments. >> Yeah that's every single competitor in the space has that what I wanted to do is like okay now you have this as well which is was not in the original version because now people were asking it so they were so used to it like okay I'm just going to add a sidebar but if you want like this is how you can use it as well which is all visual. So you can basically interact with it as you would be normally in a video editing timeline, right? So for example here now I have two elements and there's not enough space for them to appear. So what happens is that now there's grouping. This is similar to Figma where you have comments and you zoom in and out and there's grouping. Now when you when you group what happens is if I click on it it's going to zoom to the minimum level. There's an algorithm that calculates what is the minimum level of zoom where both of them are in their expanded state. There's also a second state which is like if you see if I start to zoom out and you see that now they collide. If I take another zoom one of them is going to be collapsed in this state and again if I click it's going to expand to the minimum level to which the timeline is is expanded. The grouping system it took a lot of iterations to get right because there's so many things like for example here there's three elements and then two groups can collide as well and so they're going to be merged in a bigger group or a group can collide with a collapsed element or a group can collide with a full element. So there's also a little springy animations when a a group is created to give you that idea that they've been kind of grouped together. That's been quite complex to do. Also, there's different shapes. Like this is a circle. It tells you that it's a different shape than this, which is more similar to to an element. So the circle tells you, hey, there's more of one and the rectangle tell you there's only one. >> How are you keeping track of all this? Like how do you make sense of all of these different possible states and build something that is elegant? Like is it all happening at once? Do you sit down and map it all out? Is it like you add one at a time and play with it and see where it breaks? >> It's it's a lot about playing with it. So when I think of this, I do it of course with the AI, but I I know to code. I know it's I read all the code. I'm writing like maybe 5% of the code and it's mostly like front end changes. What I care about is that okay, is the AI planning it in or or developing it in a in a crazy stupid way and then I can intervene. So it's mostly about code architecture rather than I don't give a crap about the cleanest code and the most compact. I don't care about that. But I care that the architecture of the code and like okay everything is centralized. There's not five functions that do a slightly different thing than one another. Uh or the back end architecture is done properly like all these things that are important. But so for example here it's a lot about all these little like front end tweaks and interactions and mouse versus keyboard versus uh like a mouse pad in trackpad. So I just use it. So I start with an idea of what might be the edge cases here. So what I would usually do in this case is okay let's say that now we have to build this expandable timeline. Imagine that we have the list of comments we have a timeline we have to create an expanding thing. The first thing I would do is I I do research myself but in the meantime I send off cloud code which is my main like coding model that I use. I send it off to do some research like what is the best are there some libraries pre-builts that already exist that do uh timeline expansion and contraction. Okay cool. And then I see okay are they viable to implement? Okay, then let's try it. If they are open source, then it's fine. A lot of the times, like in this case, I found that there are some limitations to those. So, I'm like, okay, we're going to need to build it from scratch. I I ask, okay, like are there some best practices that we need to build that we need to take into consideration when we're building a system like this? And maybe it's about okay like when there's like 200 elements we don't need to render those outside the viewport because it can it can the performance can get lowered and like all these little things that usually the AI can just figure out and get from documentation from the internet and you're going to be like okay we need this we need this this is too like we don't care this is too much of an edge case like let's take it for later. So it's going to create like a first version and already in my prompt I can think of some edge cases like okay what happens if two things collide and I tell it I tell the AI what do I need to happen in this case like okay if they collide then they are grouped together I this is a bit more complex and then I start to use it and most of the time I I then I notice the things that are wrong with it like or okay actually if we are on the corner if we are on the on the like one thing is that if I am on the edge here if I'm all the way to let's say that I move this Here you see that now it cannot go past >> the the end like now there's an exception so that I can move the indicator >> but the comment stays there and that by the way affects all the math of everything else. Do I know by heart every line of code behind this? No, I don't. But because the the risk is kind of more limited in the sense that uh it's it's more of a front end change than like a security backend thing. I'm okay with it and I just, you know, use it until it feels good to me. Use it until like I I think there's some bug or something weird. So, another thing that is kind of more hidden away in this is uh let me see. Okay, [snorts] so let's go back to a simpler example here. So with the playhead, what can happen is that okay, I'm in this situation and now the feedback I got from people at the beginning it was more like Figma where you have this this bar right here was uh more like okay I create a rectangle and then it's in this kind of plus create mode and then I draw a rectangle. But what all of the people were doing in my user tests was basically taking the the comment button, it becomes a plus and then they were always trying to find the play head and put it onto the playhead. So at some point I'm like, okay, people just want to create things where the playhead is fine. I'm going to make it simpler. But now, for example, this is an edge case. You have this this timeline here. The playhead is not visible in the viewport. So when I hit C, which is my uh command shortcut, or I click on it and I focus on the on the toolbar here, >> the viewport out auto moves so that the playhead is centered, then like, oh, actually, yeah, I'm creating something here and there's this pulsating thing which tells me where I'm creating things and I can tweak it as well. I think like a lot of the design theory would tell you, oh, you have to think about feedback. You're not going to think about it until you try it and you feel that, oh, I created something, but I don't know where and then you go ahead and fix it. So it's just it's a lot of you know trying it out yourself as you build it and making sure again that you have a high standard for for all the things that that you build or another one is so let's say that I start to zoom in and I have this display head that moves right so it's moving uh it's moving along but you notice that the timeline is also slowly moving so that I can just watch through the entire video and don't need to to you know like scroll manually to to follow the playhead. But an interesting nugget is that this is because one of my users were like, \"Hey, I find myself scrolling all the time to to follow my playhead. Can't can you just like do it automatically just like Final Cut does?\" I never use Final Cut. So, I just downloaded like a trial version and I spotted an interesting thing that Final Cut does, which is that of course when you start to play like you see that now we start the play with the playhead in this position like on the edge of this of the video. So if I hit play, the playhead is slowly but surely going to move to the center because the speed that at which the timeline is moving is a bit faster. And so if I now go 2x speed, it's going to do it up until it's in the it's exactly in the middle. And now it's going to stay in the middle and kind of be fixed over there. >> And same thing like this. If I put it here, you see that slowly going back. So the speed adjusts to center it. It's a small little thing. If I didn't see it in Final Cut, I would never have thought to implement it into Flask, but it's like, oh, this is cool and it's a nice detail that, you know, probably most people are not going to notice, but it's it's cool. And now it's got to talk about it in a podcast. So, [laughter] well, okay. So, you notice the detail, you want to incorporate it, maybe you don't remember, but like rough idea, how easy or hard is it for someone like you to then implement that detail with cloud code? >> Did this take a whole day? Was it pretty close to >> I would say the the hardest things to implement are the boring ones like authentication done properly backend stuff like the the weeks that I find or the where I work the hardest and are the hardest to do is for changes where if I made the change the product looks exactly the same because I've done some like backend migration or like for example there was a change where before you would have text type comments and then recording type comments and then screen type comments. So three types of comments. And now for example if I do a voice note like la test and I can also go ahead and in my clipboard take an image a view and these are all attachments to a comment >> and visa might look like a small change but now I need to completely rearchitect the database migrate all the data from the users just to allow this but now I'm much more flexible because if tomorrow I want to allow I don't know like I don't know 3D models I'm not going to do it but like 3D models as attachment and they are just another attachment in the possible like architecture of attachments. So it's >> it allows me to be faster later on. So to be honest like implementing something like this adaptive playback speed is the easiest thing to do. It's it's more about noticing that the product needs this small tweak rather than the complexity of implementing it. Now does the file with the actual code look bigger? And yes, of course, but I'm not trying to optimize for like the leakest code ever. I'm trying to optimize for the most robust and proven architecture on the code side, on the technical side that allows to get a cool experience on the user front end. >> My assumption is that's probably the answer that people were wanting to hear anyway given that it's, you know, designers, people who maybe don't have this robust engineering background. And that's at least for me why I'm so inspired by what you're doing because gosh, you've been able to throw the ball incredibly far without a dedicated full stack engineer who's handwriting a bunch of code, you know. So maybe we could even tap into that perspective. You said you wrote about 5% of code, which is maybe 5% more than most designers. Given the fact that, you know, since whenever March, you've been relying on cloud code heavily, building a lot of code with AI. Are there different tactics you've adapted or things you've learned or ways that you've maybe tweaked your process? I know you mentioned the intentional like deep research to find libraries up front. Anything else that aspiring builders could learn from? >> I don't write all the code, but I'm very attentive to what Claude writes. And this is where I think, you know, having a bit of a technical background helps. Again, I'm not the best engineer in the world, but I can understand when cloud is doing its thing and writing and explaining to you like as it does when it's doing some stuff like complex implementations, edge cases like that's where I stop it and I and I'm like no, we need to architect it better. So usually if I have to start with my process from the beginning let's say that I have to implement a new feature or something a lot of the things are boring and have been sold thousands of times like I don't know authentication how teams work like how uh permissions work for something or how do you how does a sidebar you know how do you resize something these are all things that have been solved already they've been solved from a design standpoint and they've been solved from a technical standpoint like how do you architect this right so for example right now what I'm doing is I need to one of the boring things which is rearchitect all the permissions and like what users can and cannot do depending on like are they guests are they not are they admins and now I'm finding out I I sent uh cloud code on its own like research journey I I myself start to do some research and then I send Gemini which I think the Gemini deep research is very good like okay what is the best practice if I think about notion Figma they have very strong like a very advanced permissions so do everybody follows the same pattern 90% of the time yes because it's what works past and they all kind of converge to that solution like 10 years ago and there's probably some Wikipedia or some like tech blog or something that explains like hey this is the pattern that you follow you have like in this case it would be like a table where you have all your roles and all your like actions you're trying to do and you match them and you have and whenever an operation you try to do an operation you do a check with this table and so now you're like oh okay that's how the industry does it so we're going to do it as well so the next step is okay is there a library that's open source where someone has already done is for me in this case let's say that there's not okay so then we're just going to build it but now you have an understanding of how the industry does it versus hey we need proper permissions for our members and then cla is like okay I'm just trying try to do my best right it's like saying I know how to draw but I'm trying to do impressionism but then I have never seen an impressionist painting right if this is an already solved problem then just stick to what works and don't try to innovate and then just pick your bells pick this few things that are really unique to you. For example, the expandable timeline. Okay, that's something that no one else has done in this way, and that's where I'm going to spend my time and make it really mine. But do I want a super custom permissions? Like, no. I just want what people are familiar with, what's easy to build because it's not in my core proposition. I have the most advanced permissions in the world. Like 90% of the things you do are like this. They're like being solved by someone before either technically or design-wise. If I make another example, like do we want to go and build a new way of selecting and creating tags? Right. This is I I I'm I'm not ashamed to admit it. It's copied from notion because they did it so well. Like >> that's where I would look too. >> Yeah. So like, okay, you have your list and you can navigate with the keyboard and then I can start to type and if it's if I type F7, it's a filter and then or it's a create. >> Yeah, >> it's simple. It works. They've done it. People are using notion already that are probably using Flask. So why do I need to reinvent the wheel here? Unless this is my core thing that I want to do better then there's no need. So in this case I didn't copy the technical side of it. I copied the design side of it. Most of the boring technical things they are again already being solved. In some cases there there is a best practice but it's so complex that you might want to offload it to someone else and pay them. Like for example at the beginning like oh I'm just going to store and process my own videos. That's a company in itself. So especially like if I had 10 10 engineers that are expert with video processing, okay, I can do it. But at the moment I'm not. Now if you ask claude to design to build this, what it would do is, oh, let me write this from scratch. And I would say no, let's go and find some developer that has done this has been solved like thousands of times and look at that. There's some libraries that do this perfectly. So we're just going to use them and just, you know, there's a documentation. Cloud's going to read the documentation and it's going to implement it. And even in my app now, there is one function that is kind of a utility function and every piece of the app now in the future that needs a calculation of time ago between two dates or two timestamps, it's going to call that. Probably some engineers that are watching this are going to be like, yeah, duh. But [laughter] this is how you build something that is scalable and hopefully has, you know, as little bugs as possible. Uh or for example here like you see that now if you have this like if you open a folder here like you preview a flask it has this sidebar right here which tells you okay this is the asset these are the comments I can filter this looks awfully similar to >> Mhm. >> the sidebar inside an individual flask. If I open this one up would you look at that it's very similar so similar that it's literally the same component. There's some different things that happen like this component needs to be rendered in here but also in the main dashboard. So there's some magic in going on to allow that, but I made sure that it's the same component. And now I designed it in and I designed it in a way as well so that okay, the things that are here make sense both in there and in here. But now we have one centralized component that does both things. And it's not to bash on designers, but like having that technical, you know, actually I need to implement it later on makes you, you know, change your perspective. Like now you think, okay, >> I need I want to preview something here and I have a page where I have actual information and like actions about my my flask in this case. So if I didn't have to implement this, I would be like, oh, let's create a new preview thing that's perfectly optimized for this and it's going to have like 60% of that. Uh, and then another one for here. Now that I have to build it, I'm like, wait a second, can I just use the same literally the same component and maybe with some like conditionals of like different things? But turns out I think yes. So that's how it came to be and how it works like this. So >> it forces a level of system thinking almost. >> Yeah, it forces a lot of system thinking. I also think like do I really want to implement this like super perfect design that I that I created for myself that it's such a pain in the ass because it has so many edge cases but it's just to make it look a bit more beautiful. Probably not. And that's fine. Uh and that's that's what gets to the 9010 that I was talking about. Now, is it an excuse to have like a shitty working component which is the main component of your app? No. That's what people look at. That's what people, oh, this spring animation is cool. If I put a springy animation in some like godforsaken place in the UI, nobody's going to notice it. But the work here, I think it's going to pay off because it's the main piece that you're going to interact with. >> So, I couldn't help but notice you also have a little Figma file going. So, can you just talk about what are you doing in Figma versus in code? But my assumption is the bulk of it's in code, but you know there's a there's a lot of stuff in here too. So how do you think about the different tools that you reach for? >> Yeah, I use Figma so much that I'm on the free plan. Uh [laughter] um because of with my experience with Maze, I'm like when I started this, I'm like, okay, I'm just going to design it as my designer would have done in at Maze, right? So okay, let's build all the components with different states. And this has been sitting collecting dust for months because at the beginning I'm like yeah let's do all this and it is helpful at the beginning but you see that the more I go right on the file the more messy and random it gets like this is complete chaos because it's for now it's just me and maybe if some more people come along it will become more organized but Figma forb has been mostly useful in two places one place is very very high level like I need to think about how the redesign of a screen would look like. So, for example, and I do it in a very crappy way to be honest, like let's take the I don't know the dashboards here. So, okay, like let me screenshot how like Google Drive looks like or this is the old flask or this is frame.io, my competitor, this is Figma and I I got some inspiration. Uh, and then here what I would do is like this is not like a fully designed UI. This is literally screenshots. So, this is a giant screenshot of Flask at the moment. And I just blacked out the bottom like oh what would this look like if it's like a canvan board and so then I created some like quick rectangles and this is literally a screenshot I think you can see the edges a screenshot of flask at the moment because I didn't have a fully upto-date Figma file with the latest components as they were in the UI and I don't care I just like you can see that the the indicator get got cut off here because even this this is just a screenshot it's not like a real component so all I need is how would this more or less feel like if it Because a cam board will look like this. Okay, then it could be useful or not useful or it might be a good direction to go into or not. Or like yeah, vertical board view like what if we have a cam band that is vertical and it's kind of you scroll. Could it work? I don't know. Let's try and see in 5 minutes how it's looking like. It doesn't need to be perfect also no. Uh or like here, okay, like this is the new this a bit more refined. But again, you see that the flask don't don't look anywhere close to the final ones. But I don't care. It's more like give me the the gist of like as a structure. Does this make sense? So this is one way I use it. Like super high level, very rough like >> sketching almost like you're just like high level IIA kind of stuff. >> I think this is basically wireframing just with a bit more styling because otherwise I don't like it's it's too wireframed. >> Yeah. >> So that's that's kind of how I think about it or like to take some random notes. For example, here I was trying to be to create a component, the component for the recordings, which is what we saw in this component right here, which is the component that we have for all the recordings in Flask, which is the like you have it here, but you have it also for audio recordings as well. And again, if you were a designer on your own and someone else has a build, it's like, oh, let's create the perfect video recording component and the perfect audio recording component. I'm like, \"No, because I know how the back end works and like I architect it in such a way so that they are basically the same thing. It just one has video and one doesn't. I want one component that can work in a decent way with both some like a waveform to be displayed. It makes sense and a 16x9 video preview to be displayed. So, I was just like trying out with different like layouts and how this could be, you know, working. And this is not like pixel perfect to the final one, but I don't care. It's more like, okay, how do I lay them out so that the information kind of makes sense? And on the other end of the spectrum of how I use Figma for for this, I actually need some very detailed things to try out. Like I don't know, for example, this this is literally the playar the playar for Flask. So you see that this is kind of my I decided, oh, this is a cool color gradient, so I'm just going to use it as my kind of signature playar effect, right? I just needed an asset and I just, you know, designed the asset in Figma. And then these are my colors that I also use for my my like main CTA and stuff and that's how I got it. Uh or like I don't know at some points there was some gradienting that I needed. So I just create this gradients uh with some yeah I don't even know what's in here like some layer blurs and stuff and I just you know I use Figma to to create that asset or for example here are the actual product hunt images that I used when launching in product hunt. like you need some images, I just create them in Figma and I I like to use that or now I'm toying with the idea of changing the logo to like character so that the character can have like different states based on oh things are saved up or uploading or they're recording and so I mean I'm not the best like character designer but it's more like would this make even like I'm probably going to get this redesigned by someone that's actually you know able to do this properly but it's more to get a sense of okay like would this look decent and just like experimenting with these is like super small details. So let's say that I want to implement this. Now I have some SVGs that I can use or I I don't know possibly can animate uh for this. So that's how I use Figma or like here again this is another example of some wireframing of how the landing page would potentially be looking like. It's just a bunch of random stuff like whenever I feel the need to just open Figma here for example there was some exploration on how this component would look like. So, we need to record camera, we need to record mic, we need to record video. We have some options like how does this work? Like when it's recording, how does this look like? It's like a 16x9. Uh when it's just text, how does this look like? And okay, default focus recording. >> I get the spectrum now where it's like things kind of almost feel like granular, more graphic design all the way to very highle strategic. Let's just kind of make sure this general direction feels right. And then it sounds like basically everything in between you're just working with cloud code. >> Yeah. I mean if there was a way for this to be perfectly synchronized with what's on the on the actual product, of course it would be great. But >> yeah, >> for me it's not that important. Like a lot of the times I just create something quickly in Figma to just take a screenshot and show it to Claude and be like, hey, this is the structure that we need. This is the layout that we need. For this stage, I think it works well this way. Once you start to get more established and like you have a proper, you know, like design system that's like I think it makes more sense to to organize it. But for this stage, anything more than this to me would feel like I'm wasting time. >> Before I let you go, I kind of want to tap into your perspective as someone who one was at Maze also had more of the product background and hear a little bit about how you've approached user research feedback. I would imagine you're at the point now you got enough users where it's probably mostly inbound, but maybe we could go back in time a little bit before you had launched. What were you doing to learn in those early days? How did you structure different research interviews any tactics that we could pull from in that bucket? The main challenge of course is finding users from your target audience and on this that's why like building for yourself for is very helpful because I mean I am a I'm a YouTube creator so I just you know called up a bunch of my friends that are also YouTube creators like hey I'm building something do you want to get it on a call before I launched anything before I had anything it was most mostly on understanding okay is is there a problem here to solve and if you if you really want to get the 9010 of uh user research Go read the mom test like all all the basics are in there. Just don't try to lead your users. Just lead by instead of saying what are the main problems that you're facing. Just try to ask describe to me a normal workflow for you. Like if you're doing videos, okay, just describe me the the the video process or start to finish >> and they are going to then tell you oh actually here now that it comes to mind there's some like problems or like some weird workflow that I have to do to do X Y and Z. I would just you know take the interviews just take some random notes and just you know all the interviews were me like I was running them so I just could find easily patterns just write down okay like this is the general behavior of people this is how they feel about frame.io or some other current product that they are using for collaborating on video. I would say that it gets easier but also harder once you build the product because now you have something to show them and they can use it. It's a it's a lot about again trying to remove the suggestions that they give you like hey I would want this feature or like this should work in this way like this is the stuff that you as a builder have to think about. What you really have to ask is why would you want that? like what what is the end goal that you're trying to get from like having I don't know maybe they say they want an API that there are people here that want flask API okay cool I noted that but why do you want that like what is the thing you're trying to do here and then you find out that they're like oh actually I want to have like connected to notion and blah blah blah because I just want a place to see all the latest comments from all my videos that I'm working on because I'm a I don't know supervisor cool so then what you need to build is not an API but a feed of all the most recent comments from the entire workspace. Sometimes you need to just build what people tell you. Like I've been resistant to the idea of having a sidebar of comments for so long and then people have been telling me it to me for so long and I'm like okay fine let's build it. And now I actually see myself that it was a good idea and I actually use it myself. But it's about deeply hearing what they are like what their core problem is and not listen to the solution that they are trying to give you just because you know like they're doing their best like they just a user and it would be like me trying to tell you know a pro race car driver like how to turn better on a corner the problem to solve is just like let's not crash. [laughter] So, and also your early interviewees can become great evangelists for whatever you're building later on. Like I got to meet so many cool people from those early interviews and they are still like actively excited about the product and sharing it. So you can cultivate those relationships and right now I'm trying to do like I'm at a later stage but I'm trying to do this in a different way where now I'm trying to on board some like larger teams and I might not be meeting all the features that they need or like so so now it's more about okay right now I don't have what you're looking for in terms of all the features but I'm expanding the product and building it so just jump on board as a customer and then you're going to be the partner that we'll build this together with. So, they're going to be the ones that are really wanted to to tell you like, hey, you should build this, you should build that. Uh, and then you have the job of taking that information, extracting what you what you should actually build. Sometimes it's the thing you they tell you to build. Sometimes it's something different that solves the problem that they have. >> Well, let me go. I'm quite inspired by your journey and how much you've been able to do by yourself. And wearing every single possible hat from storytelling to design to building and product strategy. I think in many ways you're creating the blueprint that I hope a lot of people watching the show follow. So I appreciate you coming on today and pulling back the curtain, showing how it works. >> Thank you. It's been great and uh yeah, big fan of the show. So it's great to be here. [music] >> Before I let you go, I want to take just one minute to run you through my favorite products because I'm constantly asked what's [music] in my stack. Framer is how I build websites. Genway is how I do research. Granola is how I take notes [music] during crit. Jitter is how I animate my designs. Lovable is how I build my ideas in code. Mobin is how I find design inspiration. Paper is how I design like a creative. And Raycast [music] is my shortcut every step of the way. Now, I've hand selected these companies so that I can do these episodes full-time. So, by far the number one way to support the show is to check them out. You can find the full list at dive.club/partners.",
