  Your React frontend shouldn't be managing your AI's plumbing. In this video,
  Amit Maraj shows you how to build the "General Contractor" of your AI system:
  the Orchestrator. 


  You'll learn how to use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to manage remote
  specialists using RemoteA2aAgent, implement a feedback loop with LoopAgent,
  and build an EscalationChecker that acts like a building inspector. We'll also
  cover how to stream real-time status updates to your user, ensuring they
  aren't staring at a blank screen while your distributed squad gets to work.
