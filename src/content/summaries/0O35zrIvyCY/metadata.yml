title: Exploiting Your Unfair Advantages - Shirley Wu (Shirley Wu Studio)
description: |-
  Shirley Wu is back-to-back on The Work Item - we previously talked about her unexpected career in data visualizations, but for this episode we're switching things up a little bit and instead focus on building long-term career advantages based on Shirley's experience. This is an especially important topic in the era of AI, where folks have a lot of uncertainty about their career tracks and what it means to build durable moats that can survive the industry being upended by new tools and approaches to getting things done.

  Shirley's experience is particularly relevant here as an independent studio owner - she's someone who has years of experience to lean on flying solo and seeing how one can establish their own reputation and image in the space.

  You can find Shirley on the following sites:
