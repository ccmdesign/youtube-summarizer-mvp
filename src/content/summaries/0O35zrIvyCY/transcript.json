  "fullText": "writing is uh it's really difficult but also really beautiful in in a similar way I think to teaching because I feel like it really really helps solidify um how we think about something and I think it really um every time I write it furthers my understanding on something or an understanding of myself and so that's something that I never want to give up to um our uh any um anything you know to any AI find where your sacred space is that AI is not allowed to enter. Putting different sort of charts into different sorts of dashboards. Um that that's never been where that's never been how I frame my service to my clients. Um the way that I um have always kind of my my competitive strength has always been in creating custom solutions, thoughtful custom solutions for clients um that can't that where the dashboards and out ofbox solutions are not working for them. Hello friends, welcome to another episode of the workout and podcast and boy do we have a good episode for you today because Shirley Woo is back back for part two. Welcome. >> Hello. Thank you so much for having me back. >> Well, we had a lot of topics on the last show and clearly we did not go through all of them, so we had to do a part two. Uh, I'm excited to be talking to you today because I know that there I'm sure there's going to be a part three and four in the future because there's just so much I have sheets of paper to talk about all these questions. >> Thank you so much for preparing so much material. Uh >> you are a I want to say a visualization master extraordinaire like you are somebody that is very good about bringing stories to life with the help of visualization and you've you know we talked about on the last show we don't need to kind of rehash a lot of the stuff but like you are the person I would look at as the model for building a lot of these kind of interactive um online or computerized visualization that present data in very very interesting kind of in a storytelling way. Um I'm curious so from from the work that you're doing and because a lot of them are fairly elaborate like we talked about like the Hamilton visualization there is the movies as flowers which is great. When do you know that your work on a specific visualization project is done? Because it seems like you would be in this constant state of like okay but like one more thing I can I can tweak this I can add this one more thing. When do you know that it's done? Oh, I'm so guilty of this. Um, that's I appreciate this question. So, um, it's funny you mentioned Hamilton because that was the one where I just kept going and going and I was like I can cuz um I I think every creator, designer, developer can relate to this that like you as the person that is so close to the project can see everything wrong with the project. Um, and like every little bug or every little thing that's not up to your standard is what's going to bother you. Um, and I think that uh Hamilton was actually the project that taught me that at a certain point nobody but nobody's going to notice but me. Like nobody's going to like notice the little edge case bugs. Um I don't know if I have like a metric for um figuring out when it's done other than like I think it's when I get to the point where I notice that I am tweaking and nitpicking things so small that nobody other than me would notice is when I ship it. Um, and it's so funny because even on my last client project, um, uh, my clients, they had a launch date and I think 2 weeks before the launch date, um, they were like, Shirley, um, you know, we don't we don't care about, you know, that like little tweak cuz nobody's going to notice it. And I was like, nobody's going to consciously notice it, but they're going to notice that there's something subconsciously like off about it. And it's all these little attention to detail that's gonna like make a make or break an experience and make a person feel like it was a good experience. I think that's it. I think it's like once I get to a point where the tweaks are no longer about like you know is it going to make or break the person's experience um in a even in a subtle way um that's where I saw >> yeah it's interesting because that kind of perfection paralysis is a thing I know for myself then you build a project and you start noticing these little things that as you said you are almost guaranteed that anybody outside looking at that project will not even care like oh this is great I love this this is fantastic But I look at it's like a that alignment is just off this. I I see the margins just like not quite putting where it needs to be. And overcoming that sometimes is hard. But I like the framing of at the end of the day you have to ship like you know you you you can just keep refining it forever. You can just keep working and working and working. It will never see the light of day. >> Yes, you're absolutely right. And actually what you say reminds me that um I think where I ship is when I fixes all of the bugs I can find um and that my clients can find and that what is left is um the gap between my vision of the final product versus like where it is cuz cuz no viewer no reader is going to ever know that that gap exists. Um and that's I think where I kind of call it done. Also something that I want to know is because you are building a lot of these very elaborate visualizations surely as you are working through them you sometimes think like wow this is going to be like massive for the people that will see this this is going to be so exciting it's going to be great um because you that that comes naturally when you ship things because you have this kind of preconceived notion that's like I I'm working very hard on this and people get excited about it but surely sometimes like things happen where like people are just It's like, eh, whatever. Like, it's it did not really, you know, it's not the level of excitement that you thought it would be from the work that you've done. Have you experienced that kind of stuff when you work really, really hard on something and then you're like, \"Wow, the reception is totally not what I expected it to be.\" >> All the time. Um, all the time. So much so that I've stopped having expectations just to just to protect my ego. Um uh because I think um you know I think that as a uh designer developer my forte is not in um UX research or like my forte is not in like you know deep um uh going out to the to market and figuring out what people's needs are. Um, that's something that I'm actively working on figuring out if there's like a someone an expert that we can bring in to figure that part out. Um, but I'm guilty until like maybe the last, you know, two years or so, I've been guilty of just like um, especially for personal client personal projects. For client projects, like the client has an idea. So, it's usually their responsibility to make sure that it reaches the right audience. But for my own personal projects, I've stopped having any expectation of how it's going to go because I don't do the upfront like research into if people actually want to see this or not. Um yeah. Um most of my um it's kind of like that irony, right? Where uh you spend like, you know, 3 months full-time working on an big elaborate thing and nobody cares, but then like the thing that you release that you worked on in like a week is like what people are obsessed over. I've stopped trying to figure that out. >> Yeah. No, I I have a very dumb example on that one and that is I as a part of my hobby when I have free time whenever that happens is um putting you know Sein have you ever seen Seinfeld the show? >> No. >> Okay. Well, the gist of it is like I I I take these short clips of like less than a minute and basically remove the audio and overlay if it's like what would be if you worked in tech and this like the '90s. >> Oh, that's great. >> It's basically like memes, right? Like so you have this like Kramer complaining about like Kubernetes or something like some stupid stuff like this. And one of the things that basically happened is like once I actually like I I literally had this idea like in 2021 like there was like everybody was locked in during the pandemic and everybody going crazy with these ideas and I was like oh I'll just put it on Twitter whatever and it just like it just exploded. It like it went viral like people just like oh my god this is like so freaking hilarious. And I was like I put like five minutes of effort into that. And then at some point I was like well people clearly enjoy this. I'll put a couple more. and then there's like crickets and you're like I actually spend time thinking through this and nothing like it's it's as dumb as it gets. But like it's true that sometimes it you know you it's hard to gauge because you can work very very hard on the project and get it in front of people and then you get crickets you get no reaction and then sometimes it got whipped up over a weekend because it's like oh this kind of a cool idea I had and it's like let's see what happens when people are losing their minds over it. It's like go figure. Um and actually this is a really good reminder of a conversation I was having with a friend of like um if we like you know conversely if we turn this around and look at it from like a different perspective it feels very very freeing because the reward is not tied to time and effort because I think that like it's I think about this a lot um as someone that works independently that um you know the first way that we charge for or charge clients is by time um and whether that's hourly or daily or weekly it's something by time. And then I think the golden place that we want to get to is charging by value. Um, and I've been thinking a lot about like how do we like separate this? Like I think especially I don't know if it's because of the industrial revolution, but like in America, in a lot of European countries and Western countries, we have an we have such an obsession with time and effort and that being tied to price. Um and I think also about how um and and and the place that I think about this a lot is um in art history actually um and you know um the pieces that we celebrate in western art history is like in the Renaissance you know it's like these big massive realistic paintings that take months and or years for like you know dozens of hands to like complete and that's what we celebrate but then when I look at like you know Chinese art like the the masters that we celebrate in Chinese art. Um I'm I'm much less familiar with Chinese art, but from my understanding of it is um you know, we kind of celebrate people that are like, you know, um five brush like how how few brush strokes um can we get to express um a um a scenery or like how expressive um can we get each brush stroke to be? And then you see like these masters of like, you know, um, uh, Chinese ink paintings and they'll finish it in five minutes. Um, but it's kind of like that answer when somebody's like, \"Oh, how long that did that take you?\" And it's like 5 minutes plus a lifetime. Um, and so it's not about the individual amount of time, but the fact that um, a lifetime of experience gets you that like, you know, painting in five hours, and that is deeply valuable. Um, and so I I'm um, and this was in the context I was talking to a friend about like art um, in the context of AI of like now that AI kind of has made things that look hard to do take only a few seconds. Um, does that mean we will maybe get to a place where we decouple value from time or price from time and we price by value instead? That's my optimism. The very little optimism I have. You're absolutely right in the sense that it's the same idea with a lot of the trades, right? When people complain about like, \"Oh, I got a plumber to my house. They were there for like 15 minutes and they charged me $600.\" It's like, yes, >> but it's the 15 minutes that they spent a lifetime knowing exactly what to tweak and where and how. >> Yeah. >> That they spent 15 minutes, right? Like that's it's not because oh, like you charge them for like it's $600 an hour. Like it's not that it's not the case. It's the experience that you're paying for. Like sure, you can find something cheaper that somebody's going to spend three hours doing this for a hundred bucks and are they going to do like a worse job? Are they like you don't know? But that that that experience cost and I like that idea of decoupling time from value you deliver. And now in the era of AI, like you're you're you alluded to something that I want to dig into more and that is I I think there's a lot of kind of efforts going into the fact that AI is going to be the timesaver. AI, right? Like you can have AI generate transcripts for this podcast, which is kind of nice, not going to lie. Like not having to listen for an hour and transcribing everything by hand is great. Like there it's it's a utility use, right? throwing AI at some coding problem and like scaffold things that are boring like tests, right? That allows me to do more important things like actually focusing on the value of the product I think is kind of great. Um, but it also comes with a lot of risks that people see, right? Because there there's especially kind of in the art community, there's this hesitation that AI is going to swoop in and now all of a sudden art is irrelevant because anybody can just type in a prompt and generate whatever art they want and boom, done. Where do you see that going? >> Oh, yeah. Okay. So, I should start by saying that um I'm I feel like I'm a like a in tech a pretty late adopter of AI. I started using it very seriously maybe two years ago and I've started to kind of like figure out what my boundaries are. Um and my personal boundaries there um I will never use um uh my my e my ethical boundary is um I will never use anything trained on stolen labor. So I will never use any image generation, video generation. Um and then uh there's more things I'm still trying to figure out around um around the environmental impacts um exploited labor and um I think a lot of this discussion about AI colonialism. Um I'm still trying to work through that part. Um so this is what I want to preface by saying is like um I'm still trying to figure out my boundaries of where I use AI and where I don't. Um but um something that I've been thinking a lot about is the art side that you mentioned. Um uh and um you know even if I personally don't use AI like uh for image generation um there's like you said many people that are going to use it. Um and so what what does that mean like culturally as like and society as a whole is something that I've been mulling over for like the last two years. And I think the um working conclusion that I'm arriving at is um I keep thinking a lot about the camera and what camera did to the art field. Um, and how um, and how before camera, I think a lot of the art pieces that, you know, live on and are archived in like museums and other cultural institutions are very much like you know as close to photo realism as possible because we didn't have a camera. So the the value was in capturing um, a portrait or like a scenery. Um and then as soon as the camera came in and I think there was like an existential crisis for a generation or two. Um and but then after that we start getting really really interesting work of like um we start getting I think like um and and my art history is fuzzy but like we start getting um uh abstract art. We start getting I think we start getting impressionism. This is all out of order but um surrealism. Um, and so I think it takes it took a generation or two, but I think that there was like people that really started to I think take advantage of the fact that they were freed from having to do photorealistic things. Um, I think that um, uh, there's it's not a onetoone correlation between camera and AI because you know the camera never trained on stolen artworks. thought if we just kind of temporarily put that part aside, what I'm really excited for is how um people will um uh what kind of art people will create in reaction to AI now that AI has freed up you know the most timeconuming things what will they be making now um and also I am um I'm I remain hopeful because if we think about how you know the camera gave everyday people the access to capture photo realistic or like capture moments. But art never went away. Art is still a thing that people pursue um like as creative expression. And so I'm really hopeful that even if you know AI takes up takes away a lot of jobs now um and that you know art will persist and it will just look different. >> Yeah. And I mean, even speaking for myself, I looking at the current art landscape, like I see people actually put effort into things like drawing and having their own art style, right? Like one of the folks that I follow is Sam does art. Sam Yang from I think he's in Toronto. He's like an art. Yeah, he's he's like an artist YouTuber and he actually documents his process. He talks about like how he works and he shows it. He has an art book where he talks about his like sketches. And to me, that part of the process is much more interesting than saying like, \"Oh, how did you make this?\" Like, \"Oh, I put this prompt and here's how I tweaked this prompt.\" It's like, uh, I don't know. Like, to me, like I I get where a lot of folks are coming from, but the entire process of art creation to me is much more interesting than somebody kind of putting a text prompt and be like, \"Here, produce me an image. There you go. There's art.\" Yeah. And I think that's also something that's really interesting to me. I fully agree with you about the process being I think the process has always been what's really interesting to a lot of people. Um um I think a lot of us always want to see like behind the scenes of how somebody thought through something. Um I also think it's really interesting how AI has, you know, already started making me people shift more to like physical art or like performance art or things that are hard to recreate with like AI art and video generation. Um there's a um a uh article I read um uh about AI and art that you know has lived rent free in my mind for like four months. Um it is and I want to um read a passage from you that you know that's the passage that I I still keep thinking about. Um it is Ken Leu's piece for Big Think. Um and it's called the cinematog cinem Oh, these are big words. cinematog cinematograph the noatograph and the future of AI art. Um, and there's a passage in there where they say, um, and I quote, uh, this suggests that AI as an artistic medium based around playful intersubjectivity will be more about process than outcome. Like you just said, more about participation than consumption, more about the doing rather than the beholding. Some of the best AI art experiences are about what the AI prompts in you rather than what you prompt the AI to do. Enjoying AI art will not be like reading a book or watching a movie, but more like having a meal with your friends or playing a board game. It is irreducibly ephemeral and personal just as subjectivity itself is. It appeals to a person, not people. And I find this really exciting. That's actually a very fascinating framing that it becomes this personalized thing for you, not for the general public because you might be curious about something. You might be thinking about a concept that nobody else maybe has a mind or nobody else actually cares about. And that's fine. And this is what that enables. >> And what does that look like as we go forward? I'm not sure yet. Um but I think the little uh asterisk edit I want to make on um that passage is one of the things I am concerned about is how isolating um all these AI tools are um of like even just the fact that you know um I when I used to work at a company I used to pair program with a person and now I can pair program with Claude um when um and my favorite thing is still to rubber dog off of my husband. Um and uh this you know Chacht threatens even that is like now I'm like oh I don't want to bother him when he's busy let me just ask Cha JPT. Um so one of the things that I try really hard is to not you know use them in isolating ways. So the thing that I want to kind of edit that passage is like how do we make it appeal to a group of people and not people in general. That's certainly one of the interesting domains too because we we see that there was also an article that came out a few I believe like a few days ago. So they were talking about how a lot of the AI based applications that pretend to be like your AI friend are actually driving this exactly what you just mentioned that isolation of like well you're not talking to a person you're talking to basically a a a uh you know auto like the predictive text on steroids like that's what it is right and like how how do we rationalize the societal impact of that and the fact that people don't talk to people they talk to this AI because you Building social relationships is hard. Building an actual, you know, uh, connection with somebody and building that trust to go and be able to confine in them about specific challenges that you're encountering in life, specific things. It's it's hard, right? It takes a lot of time with these tools. Basically, people just go online and be like, \"Oh, I'm having this problem, blah, blah, blah. What do you think?\" And then the AI just spits out an answer and then there you go. There's there's your interaction. >> Yeah. And um, you're precisely right. And there's um that actually reminds me of two things. Um the first is um uh working in data visualization for a long time. I start making um uh quite a few friends in data journalism and they're you know increasingly I mean not increasing they are extremely extremely concerned about the state of truth these days. Um and how you know social media already gave us like little like uh what's it called? Um uh uh not vortexes. uh they they get Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. the bubbles of um you can just find your little bubble and everything within it will agree with you and an AI um has a risk of doing you know even more than that of like the AI it can it can just agree with you and you're depending on which one you're using it can just continue to um agree with you instead of challenging you which is what a friend might do a family member might do is challenge you and that actually reminds me of a Second thing I listened to recently is a um podcast by Trevor Noah. Um and he was interviewing the author of a book called The Anxious Generation. I don't know if you've ever um uh heard it or heard of the book. Um, and something um that uh and I'm not going to do a very good job of summarizing um uh the podcast, but um the part that it reminds me of um our conversation reminds me of is um the author was saying something like um you know uh when we uh uh and and he was talking about like uh ch children and how children are brought up now versus how they were brought up in the 70s and 80s. Um and he was saying that um when you remove um uh interaction let's say like playground interaction um between uh kids that's where kids used to you know learn how to negotiate learn how to deal with you know deferring opinions and then somewhere in like I think the ' 90s or something and and I don't remember if it's called safe parenting but like there started to be like you know there's um uh adults parents that started to swoop in. Um when you know there's like a conflict between two kids. Um and uh the the podcast was talking about how that's uh what creates a generation of people that are unable to solve um interpersonal conflict and they instead look look to authority instead to solve those conflicts. And then um well the podcast took it uh a step further and I kind of agree which is they were saying that that's how you create a generation um uh that is uh primed for authoritarian regime you know then then we go into a lot of politics but the the part that I think is really relevant for what we're talking about is um I think the same thing e even more exacerbated if we you know rely on AI for these is like we start we stop learning how to communicate with each other. >> Yeah. And it's also like we don't need to look far for that like think about like technical problems that sometimes you run into like say like you're using claude or you're using tragic or any of the modern tools right and it's sometimes you'd ask it be like can you like show me how this code works and it would give you something and then you'd actually say like that is stupid that's not it and it's like oh you're absolutely right and let me do you're and it's like right it's like and because like if you take this foundational look at it it's like well that makes sense it's an algorithm it's not a person on the other side of course it's going to tell me I'm right because I'm the the user. I'm guiding and steering it. But that does present the danger that you just said where it's like, \"Oh, I'm thinking XYZ.\" And they're going to be like, \"Oh, you're absolutely right. X, Y, and Z are absolutely true.\" And you're like, I is it I don't know like to to what degree are you going to trust that system to to do the right thing, the ethical thing, and the thing that actually does not have negative consequences? That that is hard to predict, right? >> Yeah. Um and also um you'll never you would never say to someone in real life, you are that is stupid, right? Like >> well and and you know and actually sometimes to take a very kind of somewhat contrarian take on it. Uh you have to have friends that you can share an idea and they tell you like that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. What are you even doing? >> This is true, right? This is true. >> Like you need to have that friend that's going to tell you like are you are you nuts? Like what are you even saying, man? Um AI is not not gonna do that. They're g like, \"Oh, great. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. You are you're >> Yeah. And um I think that um speaking of like, you know, AI telling you everything um you want to hear. My friend just sent me an article of um uh I feel like I think a few days ago um an article came out about how um several media outlets um investigated um and they realized that Grock 4 references Elon Musk's own exo post when when asked about controversial topics. Um that is the ultimate um what I am so paranoid about with you know these giant um tech companies run monopolizing oligarchalizing ol the like the you know the three or four major platforms we have um yeah we can talk forever about I'm so paranoid. >> Yeah. So from your perspective, how do we fight against this kind of isolationism of our societal like fabric, right? Because you're right that that does bring a degree of isolation because again, you don't need to go look for friends. You don't need to build a relationship. Just install the app and boom, you have an AI friend. Like friend, I use this in quotes. But how do we fight against this? like how do we actually bring people together and help them understand that this is not the same as actually having friends. It's not the same as actually having trustworthy relationships with other people. >> Oh, okay. That's such a big question that I feel 0% equipped to answer in any sort of meaningful way. >> I don't think any of us are to be honest. Uh but if I was to take a stab at it, um something that I also think about a lot is um that um you know American the our culture um and the American culture is based on independ like individualism um and the you know we we take pride on like the independence and um the American individualism and I think that's really great in a lot of ways But I also think that that is part I think part of our cultural fabric is also what is leading to um a lot of us turning in into like inwards towards AI like I don't think this is a tech problem. this is a cultural fabric problem of like I think we um and and also because I I contrast it to um where my family comes from and where I grew up which was in in China and Japan and that's a very collectivist society and um and I think you know um I think at least in Japan there's a two-year delay in like adopting any sort of tech so um I haven't started to really see the effects of AI on this. But um but I do think that um it's very much a like how do we tell people friends are great if they don't even have a great support network to start with because of like the individualism that so deeply ingrained in us. I think I think it's a societal thing. >> Yeah. And this is where I think I also agree with the sense that we can't just throw more tech at the problem because that's as for people working in tech that's kind of the natural things like oh if only we had a different app that allows you to connect to other friends uh actual real people uh we can call real people TM uh that got trademarked on this podcast but like this is the kind of stuff where it's like it's not necessarily about the tech. It's not about having yet another app. It's not about yet another website where you can communicate or anything like that. It's more about having that actual cultural shift of like you need to talk to your neighbors. >> Go talk to the people you live near. Like if you think about it, right, like in I similar to what you just described, I grew up in a culture that is >> uh somewhat opposite of where I am now. And uh it's very much like you talk to your neighbors. You have to ask the you know for something. You go to your neighbor, you you ask them, \"Oh, your neighbor is doing something.\" You go to their barbecue and you meet them. You know, even though you don't really interact with them here, it's like, \"How many of us do you know that you can say like confidently like do you do you know what your neighbors are doing?\" Just like what are they what do they work each for example? Like something like very basic like you don't need to know like the deep insights about their lives like basic stuff like this. And I I I'm almost certain that a lot of folks have no idea. >> Oh yeah. I have very little clue. I have heard of this mythical uh concept called a block party. >> Yeah, me too. Never seen it. I have never seen it. >> I think there I think they still exist in certain parts of Brooklyn. Um and I I think I might have passed by it like once or twice and it was very wholesome. Um but yeah, I and I think that the that podcast, the Ancient Generation podcast, I think they do delve into this a little bit. Um but I also love what you bring up with um tech is not the tech is not actually the answer to most things. I think um I was talking to my friend um who you know had just quit his uh tech job and he was like I want to you know work do something um in the climate space cuz like and you know um I'm so concerned about all of the environmental things but and then he was like but it turns out um if you want to actually um in you know enact change it's not in tech it's in policy it's in like it's in just really hard long-term work. Um uh and uh I think that sometimes living and breathing tech a lot means that we forget that change is not immediate and change is a really really long hard work. I feel like I said something really obvious but >> no it's true though it it is absolutely true because we are so accustomed to oh you need a change just push to prod right like just commit a change boom it's live. >> It doesn't work that way with people. You can't just, you know, tell your friend it's like from now on you're thinking this way and they're like, \"Okay, switch flip.\" Like that doesn't happen. Like you Yeah. It's it's it's a societal shift that I think at some point we will have to undergo and understand that people are still at the forefront. People are still it's it's all about the people. It's less about the technology those people use. And I I think that um I want to add um to a a question you did not ask, but I feel like was tangential to the question you just asked. Um which is like how do we at least you know not not about the the um isolation but about the um part of um a few big uh companies controlling our access to information. Um and um I this I've I've started to do the research of how to like you know uh build our own local AI servers. Um and uh I'm I'm really really hopeful with like all of the local open source or sorry um with all of the open source models that are out there and can we can we adopt that um in the long term. I do feel like majority of the population will still use um the um trajecourse models need some amount of technical background but I'm hoping for a small resistance. >> Yeah, I think it's a it's definitely one of those things where convenience trumps a lot of the other things, right? Like if you if you think about it, like I look fondly on the days when we used to have I don't know if you ever participated in like online forums >> where you would log in, right? It's like it's a forum for people that like flying kites. Oh, there's another forum for people that like build building like model airplanes or something, right? And you'd go into that forum and you'd have like it's just a forum. You'd go talk to these people. you see threads pop up, people sharing their things, and it's kind of like a very organic um component to it, but with time, maintaining a server is expensive. Like paying for it is expensive. uh paying for domains, paying for like and there's kind of that overwhelming amount of well I don't want to say overwhelming that's kind of overkill on the description of this but more of like there is a barrier to entry because if you want to host one of those communities it will cost you if you want to participate in that community that means now you have to go in and sign up for an account with that community you have to be there you have to right and then when things like Facebook came along all of a sudden like everything's on Facebook. Now, there's a Facebook group. You just you don't need to go outside of Facebook. Just go to Facebook. And I think that's that's a bit of a shame that that's how it ended up because I like I I don't use Facebook like I I don't I right and like and I sometimes you run into like, oh, I want to find somebody that sells something. It's like go to Facebook Marketplace. Like, really? Really? Do I have to? Right? Like, oh, you have to find this community. They're on Facebook. and like nowhere else outside of Facebook, like I can't find them anywhere else, right? And that centralization I think is not really good. Like I'm not that big of a fan of it. Like I I think it's the the idea of one entity being in control of like payments and communications and group membership and all stuff just it's just not good. It's not good for the ecosystem, right? Like and we know this from nature because like diversity in an ecosystem strengthens that ecosystem. If you have a one central point of failure, that's one central point of failure. That's bad. >> I fully agree with this. Um I um I've also been thinking a lot about like RIP to the free open decentralized web. Um I think I mean this is something um that's been a problem even before AI came along. >> Oh, of course. Yeah. >> Um yeah, but I um uh it's interesting that you covered the technical aspect of it. Um uh but I do I do agree with you about the convenience of like I know that Google AI overview is going to give me wrong things but it's still the it's it's so convenient. Um I um and uh something that uh recently I've been really really uh being aware of is um the term like cognitive offloading. And I think this was a term that existed before all the LMS, but now I think I just recently learned it in the context of Chacha BT of like um the um uh how easy and tempting it is to offload all of the hard thinking um to uh you know chipt or um any of the similar. And I noticed this about myself when I was like, \"Oh, if I make my own, you know, uh, if I build my own local AI setup where because my biggest concern with um, all of these is data privacy. So like if I make my own local contained version where I don't have to worry about data privacy and I don't have to worry about you know what all these big tech companies are learning about me like Google already knows everything about me but like I don't want all the other ones to know everything about me too. And I was like, \"Oh, if I make my own local setup, then um I can give that instance all of my past writing and then it would, you know, then I can like have it write my blog post for me presumably based on the my own tone of voice.\" And then I had to do a double take cuz I was like, \"Wait, hold on. Um I'm I'm I'm now and I I had to do a double take because I was like, \"Oh, I've always found writing hard.\" So I don't want to do it. So let me get something else to do it. But writing is hard because we have to process information and and you know and and organize it in a way that is helpful for others. That's a really important skill. Um that a lot of us are losing. Um, and it reminded me of um another thing which is um uh I don't know if you've seen um uh websites in like let's say like uh Japanese websites or Chinese websites and they just have like you know even on their front page or old Yahoo. I don't know if you remember how it's it's so much information density. Sometimes I see my parents go to a Chinese website that they frequent and it's like walls and walls of text, but they know exactly where to navigate. Um, and I think about how I've lost that ability because I'm so used to Google being like, \"Let me design for you like where to look and how to access information.\" >> Let me give you an AI summary, right? And this is like, yeah, no, I'm 100% 100% that. And this is because I I think people kind of this reminds me of that tweet that came up like a few days back as well. Like I like that we're referencing so much of the stuff that just like people wrote about and people tweeted about because it's so like relevant to all this stuff. But like somebody had a tweet like yeah life hack of reading like 30 books a week or something. Like I asked Chad GBD to summarize the book and he gave me the bullet points. Like but you did not read the book. Like that's you you're kind of like sure I can ask you to summarize. give me the five bullet points of like some book that I decided to read and it'll give me that. But it's like but that's not reading the book. You're missing the point, right? Because like reading the book is its own joy. There is its own joy in kind of going through the story and kind of drawing your own conclusions and seeing like this doesn't make sense. Like sometimes you'd be reading a book on a technical topic or something that's more kind of scientific and you're like okay I don't get it. Let me go start looking for some other source that maybe explain this. Right? Like I I I had this a lot of times for me where you have to go through this process of like you have this cognitive loop of saying >> I want to understand this better. I want to understand this better. I don't need five bullet points >> cuz that's not learning. That's basically like oh great now I know marketing because I got these five bullet points on marketing from this book. >> Like it's not the same. Like I I don't know. And then or things like writing like writing a blog post. I I I also fully agree with you because there there's kind of this cognitive effort that you put in into like let me try to distill my thoughts into something that makes sense. Okay, like this let me let me look at this this doesn't make any sense and AI can still be very helpful in that context. I put myself in a position where sometimes you can write a blog post and then prompt it and say uh let's say you are data visualization extraordinaire Shirley Woo you are reading my blog post about data visualization critique it as if you're going through the lens right and you get this kind of feedback loop of like oh here's where you did not really explain it's like okay this is great like I I have this kind of almost like a virtual buddy as overloaded term just we talked about like it's not your friend and here we are Um but like it it it can be helpful to refine my process but I am not necessarily offloading my thinking to some other system like I still think through it. I still write it out. I still compose it and then I was like and now I want feedback. Give me feedback. >> I really really appreciate that. Um I was um because uh along the lines of like what are my boundaries? Um both ethical but also from like a I don't want a cognitive offload too much. Um, and I fully agree with you in that like writing is uh it's really difficult but also really beautiful in in a similar way I think to teaching because I feel like it really really helps solidify um how we think about something. Um I think it really um every time I write it furthers my understanding on something or an understanding of myself. And so that's something that I never want to give up to um our uh any um anything you know to any AI. Um but I do think that um uh you know if I do a stream of consciousness uh writing and then I ask it for help with like reorganizing it or um I think that the biggest place that I would get a lot of help from is um to edit it into something um like edit it so that I'm not rambling. Edit it for concision um in my own voice. Uh that's where I see a lot of value. And um something else that I've uh really enjoyed thinking about is um I had a few months ago attended a panel discussion that included um a creative director from Anthropic. And when asked uh the uh you know the question of um what advice would you give to people as they adopt uh AI more and more into their lives? And I really really liked what he said which was um uh define where your sacred space is that AI is not allowed to enter. And he said for me um music making will always be my passion. music making and performing will always be my passion and that is something that um and that is a place where I will never let AI help me with any part of the process. Um so I think also I think a lot also about like where is my sacred space? >> That's a very good framing too and because I I think through the lens now that you mentioned it of like for me if I have to write code like we're going to step back into tech for a second. If I have to write code, I would very much prefer to have an AI assistant that can help me write a bunch of this code because I am in the business of solving problems for customers, whoever, right? Like, oh, I need an app that I need a script that is going to help me like organize my GitHub repos and tag them. I don't want to do this manually, right? Like, hey AI, like I don't know, quad code or whatever. like I'm write I'm try write write me a bash script that can do all these things and verify that the script works and make sure that the repos are not like I um I give it basically some specification instructions go build this and then I will still apply a good degree of my coding knowledge to see and look at the code and be like okay no this is not what I want this is not what right but you kind of steer it to that but some of this is offloaded at the same time I guess you can say like I'm dangerous enough that I know some of the stuff where I can say uh no this is not how the API should actually work. You're returning a lot of private information that you should not be returning in that in that call, right? Like you're you're equipped with the knowledge and you're using this as almost like an augmentation thing. Like I I I had a blog post where I wrote basically like this is like your mech suit, right? Like the mech suit still requires you >> to be able to control it and properly control it and how do you manage it because you're going to cause a lot of damage without it if you don't. like you just having a mech suit is not giving you superpowers. It's how you can actually control it. And so this is similar to that. But you're absolutely right that there's certain things where I do not want like I do not use it to generate art. >> I don't like I like drawing. I like I bought like a wakecom tablet that I just like doodling on. Like I'm not good at it by any stretch. I'm sure like you toss a few prompts and it can generate something like a million times better. But that's not the point. like this this to me is the thing that I enjoy that brings me joy that I actually want to learn how to do right for myself like this this is the to your concept like that sacred space this is that I don't mind AI writing code and like summarizing the transcripts of our podcast so I can easily say like you know for for accessibility reasons like somebody that is hard of hearing that they see this podcast right now launching like well I can't listen to it but boom there's a transcript that got generated the moment it got published. Like that's freaking amazing. That's amazing technology. And like there's a lot of positive uses. Like for people listening to this, this is not an anti-AII podcast or rent by any stretch, right? Like because it's it's very easy to make their like, \"Oh, you just hate AI.\" Like, \"No, I don't. I use it.\" Like I I am on a steering committee for a project that is actually like invested in making sure that AI happens responsibly, right? But with all these things, it's important to acknowledge that there are drawbacks. there's very real drawbacks that need thinking about like what are we going to do about it? >> Yeah. And I think um it's what you said the responsibly use responsibly that I think is what we're talking about is like I think AI can be a very powerful tool in in both directions and then how do we make sure that we are using it in a conscientious way. Um and and also I think it's that the sacred space is different for everyone. Um, and so, um, I'm not here to, you know, judge or make anyone feel bad about what their secret space or not secret space is. With this change happening quite a bit, like, and again, the changes by the day, like we see news popping in left and right about AI this, AI that. So, it's it's hard to even follow for somebody in the space, let alone for somebody that is outside the space like a lot of folks are. How do you see this impacting uh your job and the things that you've been doing with visualizations with bringing that storytelling through data and storytelling through art? Is it that augmentation engine? Like do you feel like it's going to save you time? >> Yes and no. Um I think that uh it actually mostly no. Um and uh um so the cheeky answer is that I like to joke sometimes that the only reason why I still have job security is because our field is so niche that the big tech companies haven't, you know, bothered to uh train their models on uh what makes uh what we do the they haven't they haven't figured out the core of what we do. Um and and so I don't feel like um my job is at any sort of a threat just yet. Um and also I think it's that um what can be automated and what can be you know what what can be like what is the majority of the um uh examples out there that you know these models can be trained on are I think uh generic enough. They're like the dashboards and you know all like you putting different sort of charts into different sorts of dashboards. Um that that's never been where that's never been how I frame my service to my clients. Um the way that I um have always kind of my my competitive strength has always been in creating custom solutions, thoughtful custom solutions for clients um that can't that where the dashboards and out ofbox solutions are not working for them. Um so in that way um I had a friend uh ask me if I feel threatened by um AI um in my work and my immediate answer was no because um you know like it it it can it can get the job 80% done really well but where I specialize in that last 20%. Um and I'm I don't feel threatened by AI. I feel um uh excitingly threatened by that's a weird phrase, but I feel um I feel like I think it's a good threat to feel is that um unlike when I started 10 years ago when there were so few of us um freelancing in this field, there's now more and more supply of really talented, you know, creators, developers, designers um in this field trying to make sense of how do we effectively communicate data. It's a really exciting problem to have where now that the supply is more um how do I make sure that I keep standing out amongst this like talented group of people um so that clients will still come to us and and choose us uh for what we do. That's actually a very good point because it ties into that differentiation in the age of AI and for a lot of folks like if your job is just slinging code like HTML CSS just basic like CRUD apps right like oh it's going to be a dashboard for your like SQLite database like that job is gone like I I would make a prediction that if this is the differentiator that the AI will do that better and I've seen it do it like sometimes like I for myself would just ask like I need a dashboard for this data like query this database for me and put the and it does it really freaking well which is great and where the differentiation on a personal level comes in is exactly you said it's a lot of this high agency and the capability of like breaking out of your own box of saying what is the thing that is so good about you that the AI cannot do and for a lot of these things is like you said you have a sense of taste which I think is irreplaceable like do you think AI is going to create the next iPhone. the way that like Steve Jobs put his like you know all the criticism of Steve Jobs aside like he had a vision he had a specific opinion and taste about how things should have been done and that taste got executed on and this is what we have today in some shape or form right like that taste drove a lot of these things and having that taste because look at it there's many more phones than iPhones before right you had all the Nokias and Ericens's and Motoras and everything and none of them had even close to the same sensibility about what customers actually want, right? And I think that is going to be key in this age of being able to look at this and say, \"What is a differentiator? What can I do differently in a way that like it's not just about slinging code? It's about actually like painting a story. It's about making an engaging experience. It's about having people kind of captivated by it and not necessarily something that's just like, oh, hey, like look, a bunch of bucks on the screen. That's it.\" because that stuff is going to be like extremely easy to do. >> So, let me actually edit my previous answer of no a little bit. I do think you're absolutely right in that um I do think that it has sped things up in terms of data analysis of like as a launching point of like um how do I explore the data and like um as a way to like um pinpoint into where in the data set should we concentrate on and then having that as a foundation to work off of has definitely like decreased the amount of time up front. Um but also I think uh even more than that what I found really really helpful that what AI has this wave of AI tools has enabled is um that I've had to become really intentional about uh uh what we do as a studio like what are the services that we offer what is our competitive mode what is our differentiation I think that I was really really lucky in that um when I started in 10 years ago because there weren't as many of us um I just got to make what I wanted to make and then put that out there. And then there were clients that were willing to invest in that. Um and and um and clients are much more discerning now, rightfully um and they think a lot more now about like ROI and what are they going to get um because they can they have access to so many more tools that can get them 80% of the way there. So um in the past year or past uh half year I've been doing a lot of like you know digging and um trying to figure out what are our like trying to figure out how to go forward with our studio and client practice in a way that is intentional. >> There is a lot of uncertainty but also a lot of excitement about what's to come. I think the technology is moving fast. I think there's going to be changes and the best we can do is figure out how do we adapt to them right and that adaptability I think that adaptability taste high agency are going to be the basically key to success in my in my opinion I think that's very important to develop that and then build that in and augment yourself with AI tools where where it is fitting on that note like I think the This podcast brought a lot of insights and a lot of thinking material for a lot of folks listening to this, right? It's something that you can digest. Don't summarize this with AI. Actually listen to it and digest it. Uh don't don't give yourself a 30 secondond five bullet point. I'm watching you. Um so Charlie, question for you. So given the the trajectory that we are headed in, what would be another piece of unconventional advice? Because I asked you last time that you would say for folks to think about like not necessarily follow but maybe like even like think about and see like what can you do to build that personal moat for yourself >> because it's one of those things that I think it's very undefined in our space because we don't often think about this especially for folks that are not working for themselves right folks that are working at some company you know you don't usually think about a personal mode what's your personal career mode but I think that's an important concept that we kind of alluded to. What can folks do to build that out for them? >> Oh, okay. So, um I love that you uh always end on such a good unexpected question. Um okay, so a personal note, um I'm going to still kind of answer this from my perspect perspective of um uh client practice and studio and competitive mode. Um but recently we started um at our studio we started taking a um business boot camp um and uh I I recently read something from um the our facilitator um of the boot camp um and he had written about picking a niche and because I think a lot of times when we talk about competitive mo and like um we're told to like figure out our niches niche and hyperfocus on that. And um uh I really wrote really like what he wrote. He said, \"You don't pick your niche, it picks you. Your niche already exists. It's not out there. It's in here in your past experiences, your work history, your wins, your referrals, your inbox. Um and to uncover it, audit your past work. Um which ones got you the best results? Which ones gave you the most energy? and spot the recurring patterns of like what industries, what problems, types of clients that keep showing up for a reason. And then double down on your unfair advantages. Um the work that feels the easiest for you but hard for others is the clue. Um your niche isn't out there in a brainstorm. It's not a decision to make, it's a discovery. Um so stop looking outward and dig inward. Um, so yeah, my answer to your question today is not my own words, but uh his name is Dan Wall, so it's Dan's words. Um, but I uh that advice really resonated with me when I saw it like two days ago. >> Double down on your unfair advantages. I think that's under underestimated extremely valuable advice because sometimes folks don't even think they have unfair advantages and like you you have to go and figure out what that is for you, right? Whether it's public speaking, writing, design, being able to put stories through vis visualization as yourself, right? Like there's a lot of strengths that come naturally to a lot of people that they don't realize that actually puts you way way ahead of a lot of others >> and and it could be a perspective based on your own background of like I have a perspective because of my you know immigrant experiences and um uh but I love this that um on this is the note that I want to end on which is um uh it takes a lot of hard work to figure out where our unfair advantages is no. Uh, Chad, PT, Claude or Gemini is going to have that answer ready for us spitting out. >> Good note to end this on, Shirley. Thank you so much for being on the show. We'll include all the links to your blog post, to the articles that we discussed in the show notes. Uh, so check those out. That's in the video description or the blog post.
