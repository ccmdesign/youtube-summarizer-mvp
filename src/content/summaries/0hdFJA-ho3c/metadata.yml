title: Claude Code is all you need in 2026
description: >-
  Claude Code in 2026 is not what it was when it launched. After a year of
  building frameworks, custom setups, and elaborate systems to make AI coding
  work, we've come to a point now where... most of that is overkill.


  In this video, I'll show you what building with pure vanilla Claude Code
  actually looks like in 2026. No frameworks. No custom rules. Just Claude Code
  with Opus 4.5 handling real professional development work.


  I'll build a real feature in a real app, walking you through plan mode, the
  clarifying questions flow, and the native features that now do what frameworks
  used to do.


  If you're just getting into AI-assisted development, or if you've been
  layering tools onto your workflow — this video will show you the simpler path
  forward.
