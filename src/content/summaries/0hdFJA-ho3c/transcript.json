  "fullText": "Clog code in 2026 is not what it was when it launched almost a year ago. And if you're just coming into AI assisted development right now, I get why it might feel overwhelming with all the noise of the past year. Frameworks and elaborate systems for managing your agents and custom cursor rules and MCP servers and swipe files for prompts. I mean, there's a mountain of advice out there telling you that you're using the tools all wrong or that you need to master this entire ecosystem before you can even be productive with cloud code. And look, I'm someone who created one of those frameworks myself, a popular one called Agent OS. And I'll be the first to tell you that here in 2026, most of it is overkill. These days, pure vanilla clawed code with Opus 4.5 is all I actually need for 90% of my daily work. Yeah, I said it. Now, before you think I'm about to tell you that my Agent OS project is obsolete now, hold that thought because in my next video, I'll show you the updates that are making Agent OS lighter and leaner for how we build in 2026. But here in this video, I want to show you what building with Cloud Code and nothing else actually looks like here in 2026 and why the path forward is simpler than it looks. Now, if you're just finding my channel, I'm Brian Castle. I help professional builders stay ahead of the curve with AI. And every Friday, I send my builder briefing. That's a free 5-minute read where I give you my real take on what I'm seeing in our craft and our industry week to week. No hype, just what's actually working. You can get yours by going to buildermethods.com. And if you're serious about adopting Claude Code this year, I just launched a new course for 2026 called Build with Claude Code. And that's available to Builder Methods Pro members along with our community of builders. And so to show you what I mean, I'm going to build a real feature in one of my real apps right now. And so this is inbox summaries. It's a tool that summarizes feedback and messages from my audience and sends me regular reports and trends on and insights. And so this is the app that I have uh running locally here. And uh and so here is like one of the reports that it sends me every week. Um you know, showing me some like audience research survey insight data. So, I get these every week with some trends and some data points, but I want to kind of pull together all of the overall insights into a new trends view over here. You know, something visual with like graphs and metrics. So, I'm going to show you how I would go about just beginning to plan this feature and then building out a spec. And then we'll actually build it out in this video. So, I'm going to start by launching Claude. And I have a shortcut to launch it in YOLO mode. I like how they still have the uh the the winter theme here. Now, first thing I'll do is tab into plan mode. Um, most big features I always start off in plan mode, but I'm actually not even ready to have it create the actual plan or the spec just yet. First, I still need to plan out like what what's going to go into this feature, what's in scope, what's out of scope. Right? So, I'm going to start off with a simple prompt and I'll just use uh some voice dictation for this. I want to add a trends view, analyze all of the functionality around those areas and suggest some ideas for what we might put into this trends view and make some suggestions as to which items should be included in a V1 of this feature and which items might add complexity that we should probably push off for a future phase. So, you know, I'm just starting off by voicing some of the actual strategic product planning questions that I would have in my mind and I would want to think through. I'm just going to pose those to Claude, which has full access to my codebase and uh and it's going to come back with some ideas. So, let's let it cook on that. Now, as you can see, it's analyzing my existing codebase, and it launched three agents uh under the hood. You know, Cloud Code just decided to do that. It's essentially using sub agents, and they're running in parallel. It it sent off three different agents to explore, you know, different parts of my codebase to help inform its answer to my strategic planning questions. You know, the amount of change that's happened just in the past year has been unbelievable. Less than 12 months ago, cloud code was brand new. Yeah, the models back then were capable but inconsistent. We'd prompt and sometimes get great results, and other times it'd be completely off. And there were real gaps in our workflow. And so those of us who've been excited about where AI in software development could go, who could see the potential even through the rough edges, we felt those gaps acutely. We wanted this to work. We could see it was close, but the tooling wasn't quite there yet. So we built things to fill those gaps. And that's why I created agent OS. I wanted a way to inject my standards into cloud code. I wanted a planning phase that would ask me clarifying questions before building anything. I wanted task tracking and structured specs. And I wasn't alone. Frameworks and custom setups proliferated last year because experienced builders were trying to bridge the gap between what cloud code could do at the time and what we needed it to do. And that was the reality of 2025. All of that tooling created a kind of noise. If you stepped away for a few months and then came back, it looked like you needed to learn 15 different systems just to be able to use cloud code effectively. All right, so Claude finished its analysis and it came up with a few clarifying questions to help me think through uh the scope of what should go into this feature and and maybe what should be left out of it. Looks like to start off it has uh three questions for me to to think through and give some answers on. And by the way, this clarifying questions, this Q&A interface, this wasn't in cloud code originally earlier in the year last year. And so that was a key part of what agent OS provided since day one, a way to have the agent interview you to really shape the spec before it locks in the plan and before it starts building. But now, as you can see, that Q&A interface and the ability to think through and prepare really helpful, constructive clarifying questions. All of that now is a first class feature of both Claude Code and the Opus 4.5 model. So I'm going to read through these questions and give them some thought and I'll give some answers. It's even suggesting a couple different uh charting libraries and it recommends one over the others. All right. So now based on my answers and uh based on its continued analysis of my codebase and our product, it's going to formulate a plan and then present it to me to review. So I'm going to let it cook on that for a minute. And by the way, this is specd driven development. It's now a firstass workflow built right into cloud code. something that um you know I really think is essential for any professional builders in back in 2025 but also here in 2026. And by specri development I mean you know really emphasizing the effort and the thought and the craft that goes into the planning phase uh before we have the agent go off and actually build. It really makes a big difference in the level of quality and success rate that that we can have at the end of the process. Okay, looks like its plan is ready for me to review. So I'm actually going to read this in detail and uh and see if I agree with everything that it's including in the scope and its implementation plan. All right. So it's mostly good, but I do have a couple of notes uh to try to simplify the scope a little bit before we get going. So I am going to scroll down and instead of uh saying yes, go ahead and build, I'm going to go to the third option here and type some feedback to have Claude update the plan on the gem insights. Let's just focus on tracking number of gems per stream. When it comes to filtering, let's keep it simple and just include the ability to filter by stream. And so, you know, I'm working my experience into this knowing that like there are some aspects of this that could be a little bit more complex. I'm sure Claude Opus 4.5 could probably handle it just fine, but I I do want to keep the feature somewhat simple. No need to bloat the codebase unnecessarily. So Claude is going to go ahead and simplify the the plan with my feedback. Okay, so the plan has been updated pretty quickly and yeah, it all looks good. So I'm going to go ahead and uh give Claude the go ahead to uh bypass asking me for permissions for every little thing and it's going to go ahead and start building. So Claude's getting to work and it created a to-do list for itself. Again, that's something that agent OS used to do as well. it would break a speck out into a task list. But now that's just sort of built into the way that claude code works by taking a plan or a spec and breaking it out into tasks that it can track over a long period of time. So we're going to let this work for a while and then we'll come back to it. So what changed here in 2026? Well, two things converged. First, the models got dramatically better. Opus 4.5 specifically, but also Gemini 3 and GPT5. Now that we're a few months into working with these frontier models, it's clear now that we're truly at a turning point, both in terms of what the models are capable of and an observable increase in adoption. The models understand our intent better, and they maintain context more reliably across really long sessions. And they execute complex multifile changes with significantly fewer mistakes. the back and forth cycles where you're constantly fixing and reprompting and redoing things, those have dropped way down. Not to zero, but enough that the workflow feels fundamentally different now. And second, cloud code itself evolved. Plan mode overall is polished and reliable now for powering a specdriven development approach and features like skills and sub aents give you targeted capabilities without the framework overhead. So the bottom line is much of what we built scaffolding for back in 2025 is now just part of claude code. Okay, so uh Claude is all finished with its work. So let's uh let's see how we did. All right, so I see it added the new trends view here in the navigation. Yeah, I see a functional trends view with uh with some graphs, but there are some front-end UI issues that I think we're going to need to smooth out. Uh so I will need to give it a bit of feedback to fix some of these. And I think part of the reason why I'm seeing this is because I initially forgot to invoke the front-end design skill, which I have in my system, but forgot to include that in the in the plan. And then I inserted it into Claude's work uh midway through. So you can see here I said be sure to use the front-end design skill when designing new UI interfaces for this feature. So that was my mistake. I should have done that earlier before Cloud even began its work. And so I think that like inserting that midway through might have uh thrown it off a little bit and resulted in a little bit of inconsistency here. But this looks like uh the kinds of things that I think we can uh probably smooth out with a bit of feedback. All right. So I pointed out a few UI issues and I provided uh several screenshots along with those. So let's have Claude uh work on those fixes. All right. So, uh, it took a few minutes to fix, uh, those UI issues. Let's, uh, restart the server and see how we're doing. Okay. Yeah, this is much better. Yeah, it's totally in line and consistent with the other pages. So, those layout issues are fixed, and it's now using the consistent card style that we've already established in the app. And let's see how we're doing on mobile. Looks great. And, uh, everything in the app is dark mode, including this trends view. So, this is perfect. I would say this is uh pretty close to a shippable state. Now, let me show you a couple of core features in cloud code that really matter when you're doing professional work like this. Cloud skills are becoming an essential tool. Now, you can still do a lot without them, but when you need specialized workflows or capabilities, Claude skills really help you up your game. For example, I just invoked the front-end design skill to build this trends feature. The Claude team actually created that one and it adds some design muscle to the front-end design process. Another one is context management. You can always pull up older sessions to pick up where you left off or rewind if your context gets off track. Small power features like this in Cloud Code really make a big difference in productivity. Now, I want to be clear about something. When I say that Cloud Code handles 90% of the work, I don't mean that I just type a prompt and magic happens. Our experience as builders matters more than ever. It's just applied differently. The models can implement any pattern we describe, but they can't choose which pattern is right. They can't understand your users. They can't make strategic calls about what to build and why. Product thinking and knowing how to formulate real solutions for real people. Understanding the difference between what a customer says that they want and what they actually need. That's the craft now. And honestly, that skill will never be obsolete. It's something that we should always be working to improve. There's always another level, especially now. The bottleneck isn't writing code anymore. It's knowing what to build and how to structure it. And that's where our experience becomes our multiplier. And so when I say that cloud code is all you need, I mean that the tooling is all you need. But your judgment, your taste, your product instincts, that's what makes it work. Now, I said that cloud code and nothing else could handle 90% of the work. But what about the other 10%. Well, there are still some scenarios where some additional structure could help. One is green field product design. So when you're starting from zero and you need to establish a design system and UI patterns and an architecture before you have a codebase to work in and that's actually why I created design OS. Yeah. And sure that's a free frameworky thing but really it just gives you a structured process for using cloud code in the design phase before the actual building begins. Another scenario is when you're working with legacy code bases where you have established conventions and having those standards documented and then easily referenced by agents can help bring those projects into today's AI first workflow. And that's an area where I think agent OS could actually help. But here's the important takeaway. You should notice when you need something more than just claw code because you'll feel that friction. The mistake is assuming that you need extra tooling before you allow yourself the opportunity to be productive using just cloud code and nothing else. So whether you're just starting to use cloud code or you've been deep in frameworks and custom setups, the path in 2026 is the same. Start with pure cloud code, learn the native features, but more importantly your workflow. Only add complexity when you actually need it. Now, I mentioned Agent OS, and I built it to solve real problems that we felt back in 2025, but looking at it now in this landscape, I'm rethinking what, if anything, I actually want out of a utility framework like Agent OS. And so, if you've been layering tools and frameworks on top of your cloud code workflow, then I want you to see my next video. I'm going to show you exactly how I'm stripping away the unnecessary bloat and getting back to what actually matters. It's about subtraction, not addition, without losing touch with what makes our craft of building software unique. So, if you haven't yet, hit subscribe on the channel so you don't miss my next video when it comes out. And I'll see you over there next. Let's keep building in 2026.",
