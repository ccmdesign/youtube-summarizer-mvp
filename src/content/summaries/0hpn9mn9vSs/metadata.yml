title: Why AI Development Tools Are About to Shift
description: >-
  Luke from Factory AI builds Droid, and I asked him straight up: where is AI
  coding actually headed?


  His answer surprised me. The next evolution isn't about more powerful models.
  It's about AI that enforces software engineering best practices by default -
  linting, testing, CI/CD, proper architecture, all baked in.


  He went deeper on monorepos becoming standard, migrations completely changing
  and self-hostable models making this affordable for solo devs.


  If these predictions land, it's a massive shift for how we ship software.
