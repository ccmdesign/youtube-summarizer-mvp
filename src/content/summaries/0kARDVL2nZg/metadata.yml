title: How To Get Your First Users
description: >-
  When you're starting out, it isn’t enough to just build a minimum viable
  product. You also need a minimum evolvable product - one that can adapt to the
  needs of those critical early customers. 


  In this episode of Main Function, YC General Partner Ankit Gupta offers an
  update to the classic MVP playbook. He’ll outline strategies for getting your
  first customers, the power of adaptability and how feedback from early users
  will ultimately shape the future of your product and your company.
