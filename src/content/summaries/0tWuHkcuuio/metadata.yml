  This week's Briefing explores ChatGPT App Store's implications for tech
  companies, analyzes the UI and featured categories, and discusses early apps
  like Figma and Lovable. 


  Plus, Google's new AI agent for Gmail, DoorDash's launch of the Zesty app, and
  Eleven Labs' conversational agents on WhatsApp. Additionally, we review new
  tools like ManyPI for API development, the Mac app Craft, and Monocle for
  focused productivity. Finally, we cover the latest data and trends, including
  CloudFlare's annual web report and Twilio’s findings on conversational AI.
