  What's really happening with AI and the job market? The common story is that you need to optimize harder for LinkedIn and beat the ATS — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on why building your own AI interface changes the hiring game entirely:

   • Why the 0.4% application success rate means you have nothing to lose
   • How an AI trained on your work demonstrates depth that resumes cannot
   • What a fit assessment tool signals about your confidence and market value
   • Why showing beats telling in an era of zero-trust credentialing

  The same AI that broke hiring enables a different move. Instead of squeezing through their filters, you create the surface where people encounter you on your own terms. When someone queries your experience and gets substantive answers, they shift from filtering mode to investigation mode — and that shift is worth everything.

  For professionals with real depth that keeps getting compressed into bullet points, this approach lets your full shape show.
