title: MCP Tools Just Got 10x Faster In Claude Code
description: >-
  Claude Code Has FINALLY Solved the MCP Context Nightmare! The team just
  released MCP Tool Search, a game-changing update that dynamically loads tools
  into context when MCP tools would otherwise consume too much space. When
  Claude Code detects that MCP tool descriptions would use over 10% of context,
  tools are loaded via search instead of being preloaded. This directly
  addresses a major pain point where users were running 7+ servers consuming
  67k+ tokens, making MCP development far more efficient without changing how
  tools work for end users.
