    The scenario: A retail company's SQS queue grows to 100K messages during flash sales while Lambda can't keep up.


    The challenge: How do you increase throughput when concurrency is the bottleneck without losing messages?


    The solution: Reserved concurrency + larger batch sizes 🎯

## Key Takeaways

This AWS architecture question reveals the solution to scaling serverless event processing. Key insights:

- The **concurrency limit** is the core bottleneck when Lambda can't process SQS messages fast enough during traffic spikes.

- **Increasing reserved concurrency** guarantees Lambda can scale to handle peak loads, directly addressing the throughput issue.

- **Larger batch sizes** (up to 10,000 for standard queues) allow processing multiple messages per invocation, dramatically improving efficiency.

- Solutions like adding memory or converting to FIFO queues don't solve concurrency problems and can actually reduce throughput.

## Summary

The video presents a common AWS serverless scaling challenge where a retail company's order processing system hits limitations during flash sales.

### The Problem: Concurrency Bottleneck
An SQS standard queue accumulates over 100,000 messages while Lambda struggles due to hitting its default concurrency limit. Each message takes 3 seconds to process, creating a throughput bottleneck where messages can't be consumed fast enough despite the queue depth growing.

### Analyzing the Solutions
Four options were evaluated against the key requirements:
1. **Creating additional SQS queues with SNS fanout** - Doesn't help because Lambda remains the bottleneck with the same concurrency limit across all queues.
2. **Increasing Lambda memory allocation** - Makes individual invocations faster but doesn't increase parallel execution capacity.
3. **Increasing reserved concurrency + larger batch sizes** - Directly addresses the bottleneck by allowing more parallel executions and processing multiple messages per invocation.
4. **Converting to FIFO queue** - Actually worsens the problem since FIFO queues have lower throughput limits than standard queues.

### The Correct Architecture
**Reserved concurrency** removes the scaling limitation by guaranteeing Lambda can access the necessary compute capacity. Combined with **larger batch sizes** on the SQS trigger, this allows Lambda to process up to 10 messages (or more) in a single invocation instead of one message per invocation.

This approach multiplies throughput while maintaining reliability since SQS retains messages until they're successfully processed. The solution demonstrates how to architect for unpredictable traffic spikes without message loss.

## Context

This question addresses a critical real-world challenge in serverless architectures: handling sudden traffic spikes without message loss. As companies move to event-driven systems using SQS and Lambda, understanding concurrency management becomes essential for maintaining system reliability during peak events like flash sales, product launches, or seasonal traffic. AWS Solutions Architects need to master these scaling patterns to design resilient, cost-effective systems that can handle unpredictable workloads while maintaining data integrity.
