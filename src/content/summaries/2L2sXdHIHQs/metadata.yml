title: Why the Smartest Brands Don’t Chase the Algorithm Anymore
description: >-
  Community isn’t a “nice to have.” It’s the hardest — and most powerful —
  marketing advantage you can build.


  In this video, I break down why brands like Apple and Nike don’t panic over
  algorithm changes, rising ad costs, or platform shifts. They don’t rent
  attention — they own relationships.


  Most companies think they’re building community when they’re really just
  collecting followers, Slack members, or Discord sign-ups that never interact.
  Real community is different. It compounds over time, lowers customer
  acquisition costs, increases retention, and becomes a competitive moat your
  competitors can’t copy.


  I walk through the exact framework for building a community that actually
  works — without hype, parties, or vanity metrics.


  In this video, you’ll learn:


  -Why audiences are rented but communities are owned

  - The WordPress model most marketers completely ignore

  - How to define a shared problem instead of promoting your product

  - Why small, recurring gatherings beat big events every time

  - How to create member-to-member value (not a fan club)

  - Why difficulty is the entire point — and the advantage


  If you want a marketing strategy that survives algorithm changes and compounds
  long-term, this is where it starts.
