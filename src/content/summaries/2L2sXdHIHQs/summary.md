  title: "Why the Smartest Brands Don’t Chase the Algorithm Anymore"
  description: "Community isn’t a “nice to have.” It’s the hardest — and most powerful — marketing advantage you can build.


    In this video, I break down why brands like Apple and Nike don’t panic over algorithm changes, rising ad costs, or platform shifts. They don’t rent attention — they own relationships.


    Most companies think they’re building community when they’re really just collecting followers, Slack members, or Discord sign-ups that never interact. Real community is different. It compounds over time, lowers customer acquisition costs, increases retention, and becomes a competitive moat your competitors can’t copy.


    I walk through the exact framework for building a community that actually works — without hype, parties, or vanity metrics.


    In this video, you’ll learn:


    -Why audiences are rented but communities are owned

    - The WordPress model most marketers completely ignore

    - How to define a shared problem instead of promoting your product

    - Why small, recurring gatherings beat big events every time

    - How to create member-to-member value (not a fan club)

    - Why difficulty is the entire point — and the advantage


    If you want a marketing strategy that survives algorithm changes and compounds long-term, this is where it starts."

## Key Takeaways

Smart brands prioritize owned communities over rented platform audiences. Key insights:

- **Real community** requires members helping each other solve problems—not just consuming brand content.

- Organize around **shared challenges** (e.g., Word

Press Word

Camps for website issues), not your product features.

- **Small recurring groups** (10-15 people) build intimacy and loyalty faster than large one-off events.

- Facilitate **member-to-member value** by letting users answer questions and recognize contributors.

## Summary

### Community vs. Rented Audience
Algorithms platforms control rented audiences, which disappear during policy changes (e.g., Instagram cutting reach by 50%). Real communities thrive off-platform because relationships persist independently—members actively help each other, like Word

Press users fixing plugins at Word

Camps.

### Three-Step Community Framework
1. **Define the Shared Problem**: Avoid centering groups on your product. Instead, focus on customer pain points (e.g., "small teams struggling with alignment," not "users of our software"). This sparks authentic conversations.
2. **Prioritize Small Recurring Gatherings**: Weekly Slack sessions or monthly roundtables with 10-15 engaged members build intimacy. Unlike expensive conferences, repetition fosters peer-to-peer problem-solving without brand intervention.
3. **Facilitate Member-to-Member Value**: Brands must relinquish control—let members answer questions publicly, recognize contributors, and track interactions *between* users. This scales value and slashes acquisition costs via referrals.

### Competitive Advantage
Community building is hard (requiring patience and ego suppression), which makes it defensible. While competitors chase algorithms, owned communities compound loyalty and reduce marketing costs—69% of marketers increased related budgets in 2026.

## Context

This matters because platforms increasingly control audience reach via volatile algorithms, making rented attention unsustainable. Brands investing in communities—like Apple, Nike, or Neil Patel's NP Digital—gain lasting advantages: lower acquisition costs, higher retention, and platform-agnostic relationships. With 69% of marketers boosting community budgets in 2026, this strategy addresses rising ad costs and algorithm dependency across industries.
