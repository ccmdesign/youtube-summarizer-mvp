  "fullText": "Why do Apple and Nike never worry about algorithm changes? Because they've built something most brands refuse to invest in a real community. It's the hardest marketing strategy to execute. It requires patience, consistency, and zero shortcuts. But once it's built, your customer acquisition cost drops. Your retention skyrockets, and you own the relationship, not the platform. I'm Neil Patel. I run one of the largest independent marketing agencies in the world. And in this video, I'm going to break down the three simple steps to building a community that actually works. Not one built on hype, expensive parties, or rented attention. Chapter one. Most marketers think they're building a community when they're actually just renting an audience. Here's the reality. I see companies every single day throw money at what's called community building. They sponsor Formula 1. They host parties at conferences. They created Discord servers that nobody uses. They think that a Slack channel that has 5,000 people, even though nobody's talking in it, is a win. But here's what they're missing. Community isn't about the size of the group or how impressive the venue is. It's about one thing. Do your members help each other or do they just consume content from you? Because if the only interaction happening is people watching your posts, liking your updates, and waiting for your next announcement, that's an audience. And audiences are rented. The platforms control who sees what. One algorithm change and your reach is cut in half. One policy shift and your distribution disappears. Here's how you know the difference. If Instagram disappeared tomorrow, would your business survive? If the answer is no, you don't own anything. You're borrowing attention from a platform that can take it back whenever they want. Whether it's Instagram, Tik Tok, YouTube, it's the same thing. You don't want to rely on just one platform. Real community survives platform changes because the relationship exists independent of the algorithm. Chapter two. The best example of real community didn't come from a marketing team. It happened from users who wanted to help each other. WordPress is one of the largest blogging platforms in the world. They created something called word camps. These are events, but not the kind that you're thinking. They're not parties. They're not networking mixers where people get drunk and exchange business cards. They're problem-solving sessions where WordPress users help other WordPress users fix real issues. Someone shows up with a broken plug-in, someone else in the room has already solved that exact problem. They sit down together and fix it. No sales pitches, no upsells, just people helping people because they all share and love the same ecosystem. And here's what happened. These users became fiercely loyal. Not because WordPress had the best product. There are plenty of competitors, but because WordPress created an environment where members felt invested. They weren't just customers, they were contributors. That's the psychological shift most brands never make. When your customers feel like they're part of something bigger than a transaction, retention skyrockets. When they help each other, they're not just buying from you, they're buying into a system they've helped build. And the data backs this up. According to our recent research, 69% of marketers are increasing their community building budgets in 2026. not maintaining them, increasing them because they're finally realizing what the top brands like Apple and Nike figured out years ago. Owned relationships compound. Rented attention doesn't. This is why community is the hardest marketing strategy. It requires you to stop being the center of attention and start being the facilitator. Chapter 3. Step one, define the shared problem, not your product. If you're organizing your community around your product, you've already failed. Here's the mistake I see. A company launches a CRM tool and immediately creates a CRM reuser group. No one shows up. Or worse, people join and never engage because there's nothing to talk about except feature updates and release notes. Compare that to organizing around the actual problem your customers face. Don't create a group for people who use our product management software. Create a group for small teams struggling to stay aligned without endless meetings. Same customers, completely different conversation. because now you're not talking about your tool, you're talking about the pain point that led them to your tool in the first place. And when people have a real problem in common, they want to help each other solve it. This is what WordPress did, right? They didn't organize around people who use WordPress. They organize around people building websites and running into technical problems. The product became the vehicle, not the topic. So, here's the first step. Stop thinking about your product category. Start thinking about the shared challenge that brought your customers to you. That's what creates real conversation. That's what makes people show up repeatedly and that's what turns a group of individuals into a community that actually matters. Chapter four. Step two, creating small reoccurring gatherings, not big events. The brand spending millions on conference booths are building visibility, not loyalty. Let me be clear about something. Sponsoring a major event, throwing a huge party, getting your logo on a stadium, that's not community building. That's brand awareness. And brand awareness is not the same thing as owned relationships. Here's why. At a big event, people show up for a spectacle. They're there for the free drinks, the entertainment, the networking opportunity. But the second the event ends, so does the connection. There's no ongoing interaction, no real relationship, just a logo they saw, and maybe a business card they'll never follow up on. Real community happens in small groups, 10 or 15 people in a room, or a Slack channel where the same 30 members show up every week to help each other, or monthly roundts where your best customers talk through their biggest challenges together. The key is repetition and intimacy. You're not trying to impress 500 people at once. You're trying to connect 15 people over and over again until they start helping each other without you in the room. That's the shift. When your community members start solving each other's problems, your role changes from expert to facilitator. And that's when the economics flip because now you're not the only one creating value. Your members are doing it for each other. This is why community gets cheaper over time. While every other marketing channel gets more expensive. You're building a system that scales through peer-to-peer interaction, not your time. Chapter 5. Step three. Facilitate membertomember value. The hardest part. If you're the only expert in the room, you don't have a community, you have a fan club. This is where most brands fail. They create a space, they define the problem, they bring people together, and then they make it all about themselves. Every question gets answered by the brand. Every conversation gets redirected back to the product. Every piece of value comes from the company, not the members. And here's a problem. That doesn't scale, that doesn't create loyalty, and it doesn't become a competitive advantage. Real community happens when members help members. When someone asks a question and three other members jump in with answers before you even see it. When people start tagging each other in threads because they know who has the expertise. When your most engaged members become the go-to experts in your space. Here's how to make this happen. First, stop answering every question yourself. Let the silence sit for a minute. Let your members step up. Second, publicly recognize the people who contribute. Highlight their answers. Give them roles, titles, recognition. Make helpfulness visible and valuable. Third, and this is critical, measure member-to-member interaction, not just engagement with your content. If all your metrics are tracking how people respond to you, you're building an audience. If you're tracking how people respond to each other, you're building a community. This is the hardest step because it requires for you to give up your ego. You have to let go of being the center of attention. You have to trust that your members can create value without you. But when you do, something incredible happens. Retention skyrockets because people aren't just getting value from your product, they're getting value from the relationships they've built. Customer acquisition costs drop because your members start referring other people who have the same problem. And you own the relationship because it's not happening on Instagram or LinkedIn or YouTube. It's happening in a space you control. Chapter six, why difficulty is the entire point. If it's easy to start, it's easy to copy. And if it's easy to copy, it's not a competitive advantage. Here's the economic reality of marketing in 2026. Paid ads, easy to start. Everyone's running them. No barrier to entry, no moat. Going viral, great for a week, then it's gone. SEO used to be a moat, now it's commoditized. The only strategies that create lasting advantage are the ones that require time, patience, and consistent effort. Things that most companies won't invest in. That's why community is your biggest competitive advantage. Not because it's complicated, but because it's hard. It requires you to think long term when everyone else is optimizing for the next quarter. It requires you to facilitate relationships when everyone else is broadcasting content. It requires you to give up control when everyone else is trying to be the hero. And because it's hard, almost nobody does it. Which means when you do, you're operating in a completely different game than your competitors. While they're fighting over ad cost and algorithm changes, you're building something they can't replicate in 6 months. You're building loyalty that they can't buy. You're building economics that compound over time instead of getting worse. This is how Apple and Nike sleep at night when Instagram changes it algorithm because they don't need the algorithm to do well. They own the relationship and that's the only asset in marketing that compounds forever. And look, I've done it myself at NP Digital. We have a massive community that helps each other, not just with our products like Uberess and Answer the Public, but for topics like SEO and paid ads and even social media marketing. And if you want us to help you build a community, check us out at npdigital.com. So, here's the truth. Most brands won't build this. It's too hard. It takes too long. There's no viral shortcut. And that's exactly why it's your opportunity. When your competitors are optimizing the same ads on the same platform, you're building something they can't copy quickly. You're building the one marketing channel you actually own. Now, if you want to understand how search and discovery are changing across every platform, not just social media, watch this video next. I'll show you why the brands that win aren't just chasing algorithms.",
