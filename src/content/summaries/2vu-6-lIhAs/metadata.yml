title: "Design OS: The Missing Design Process for AI-First Development"
description: >-
  AI coding tools build fast—but the results are a hodgepodge. Disconnected
  screens. Generic UIs. No cohesion. And re-prompting just makes it worse.


  Design OS fixes this. It's a methodical design process that happens before
  your coding agent wires up the backend. You design the actual frontend—not
  mockups—and export production-ready components that any coding agent can
  implement perfectly.


  This video is the official demo and walkthrough tutorial.
