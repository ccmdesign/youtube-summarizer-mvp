  AI coding has fundamentally changed how we build software. In this video, we
  explore insights from Linear's CEO on Claude Code workflows, Google AI Studio
  approaches, and why coding with AI requires an entirely new mindset for
  developers.



  The middle of software development is disappearing. Traditional coding work is
  being replaced by AI coding agents that can implement entire features from
  context and planning alone. This shift means developers need to master new
  skills to stay relevant.


  We break down what the best AI for coding actually requires from you as a
  developer. It's no longer about writing every line yourself. The best coding
  AI tools now handle implementation while you focus on intent, planning, and
  review.


  Your new job is context engineering. Whether you're using coding with AI
  through agents like Claude or exploring alternatives, success depends on how
  well you set up the environment. We show you the AI coding workflow that
  actually produces production-level applications.


  The video covers how to structure your projects for AI IDE coding, including
  documentation strategies, test-driven development, and review processes. We
  explore vibe coding AI approaches and why the best AI model for coding is only
  as good as the context you provide.


  You'll learn about creating the right conditions for agents to succeed, from
  planning modes to bypass permissions. We demonstrate techniques used by teams
  shipping code at unprecedented speeds, including what makes the best AI coding
  IDE setup work.


  Whether you're interested in vibe coding in AI Studio or building complex
  applications, this video shows you exactly what skills matter now that AI
  handles the implementation phase.
