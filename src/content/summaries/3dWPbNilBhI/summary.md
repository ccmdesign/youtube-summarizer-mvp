## Key Takeaways

Apple's Siri is getting a major AI upgrade through Google partnership. • **Apple's LLM failures** forced partnership with Google's Gemini • **Privacy regression** concerns as Apple moves from edge to cloud AI • **Gemma/GEMA foundation** likely being fine-tuned for Siri's specific needs

## Summary

Apple has announced a partnership with Google to use Google's AI models for the next generation of Siri, marking a significant admission of Apple's failure to develop competitive large language models internally. The speaker expresses no surprise at this development, noting that "Apple has solved zero problems in the LLM space" and that Siri has fallen "severely behind the times" compared to modern AI assistants.

### Technical Implementation
The partnership likely involves fine-tuning Google's **Gemma** model (referred to as GEMA in the transcript) specifically for Apple's needs. Google recently released an open version of their model called Gemma, which serves as the foundation for Gemini. The speaker speculates that Apple will either fine-tune a previously adapted version of GEMA or work with a larger version customized for their requirements.

### Privacy Concerns
A significant disappointment noted is Apple's apparent shift away from **edge intelligence** approaches. Previously, Apple had been making strides toward processing AI locally on devices as a privacy and security measure. This partnership suggests Apple may now be sending user conversations to distant servers, compromising what had been a key differentiator in their privacy-focused approach.

## Context

This announcement represents a major shift in the AI assistant landscape, with two tech giants collaborating where previously they competed. The move signals Apple's inability to keep pace in the generative AI race despite its hardware advantages. This matters for billions of iOS users who will experience fundamentally different AI interactions, and raises important questions about data privacy as AI processing moves from local devices to cloud servers. The partnership could reshape competitive dynamics between Apple, Google, and emerging AI players like Anthropic's Claude.
