  What's really happening with AI and deep work productivity? The common story is that AI just helps you do more tasks — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on using AI to engineer focus instead of fighting for it:

   • Why focus is an engineering problem with three measurable dials
   • How AI can reduce interruptions and reload context faster
   • What chunking work into smaller blocks actually looks like
   • Where team culture changes matter more than individual willpower

  For operators and managers, the real leverage is treating attention like a system with tunable parameters — not a personal discipline problem you muscle through.
