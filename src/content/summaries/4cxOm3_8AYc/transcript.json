  "fullText": "John Duduk's model invites a very different question that's more useful. If the limiting factor on our deep work is how often we're interrupted, when we come back to it, how long it takes, and and how long our deep work takes, where can AI actually usefully push those numbers in the right direction. Interestingly enough, AI is often unusually good at exactly the things that sit around those three knobs. It's good at monitoring and routing, so it can watch streams of messages. It can classify urgency. It can decide what gets through. That's something we've actually seen in startups that are starting to declutter the inbox on exactly those principles. It can summarize and recall, right? It can compress past context into something that you can reload very quickly and efficiently so you don't miss something, but it doesn't interrupt you. It can also decompose and scaffold out very easily, right? It can turn big fuzzy tasks into smaller executable ones. And so instead of AI as a productivity boost abstractly, I want you to think of AI as a focus system tool. I want you to think of AI as a tool that helps you choose when and how often people are allowed to knock on your door. or AI as a tool that remembers the work state you had so your brain can reboot quickly and doesn't have to do a full reload.",
