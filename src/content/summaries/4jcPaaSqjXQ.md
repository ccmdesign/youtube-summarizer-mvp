  Marcel Bertram argues that **digital accessibility** must shift from a reactive, fear-based compliance task to a proactive, scalable business strategy. By integrating automated testing into the **design and development workflow** (the "Shift Left" approach) and using advanced tools like **AI-powered MCP servers**, organizations can move beyond manual checklists to sustainable, empathy-driven pract

## Key Takeaways

Marcel Bertram and DQ's Andy demonstrate how standardized tools and workflows can transform accessibility from a legal burden into an efficient, continuous process.

- **Shift Left Strategy**: Accessibility should begin in the design phase with annotations for headings and alternative text, rather than being treated as a final production check.

- **AI-Integrated Development**: The use of **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** allows developers to analyze and remediate accessibility issues directly within their IDE (like Cursor) using expert knowledge bases.

- **Unified Auditing Platforms**: Moving away from Excel and Power

Point toward **multi-platform tools** like Ali

Planned enables teams to audit web, native apps, and email in a single environment with automated reporting.

- **Scalable Responsibility**: Success requires an **operations model** where responsibility is shared across roles—designers, developers, and product managers—rather than residing with a single expert.

- **The Human Element**: Beyond compliance, the core driver should be **empathy**, recognizing that accessibility affects everyone as they age and that most disabilities are acquired later in life.

## Summary

### From Legal Panic to Strategic Planning
Marcel Bertram begins by sharing a personal anecdote about receiving a **105-page accessibility lawsuit** on a Friday afternoon. This experience highlighted the fundamental flaws in traditional accessibility management: reliance on complex, static checklists, fragmented tools, and a lack of standardized processes. In many regions, particularly Germany, the stakes of non-compliance are high, ranging from **heavy fines** to the potential for service shutdowns or even criminal liability for management. Bertram argues that most teams are paralyzed by a lack of skills and tools, leading to a "fear-based" approach that is neither sustainable nor effective.

### The Three-Phase Master Plan for Scaling
To overcome these hurdles, Bertram introduces a three-phase framework designed to integrate accessibility into the product lifecycle:

1.  **Prevention**: Catching issues before they reach production. This involves designers annotating layouts for screen readers and developers using **automated linting** and real-time testing tools.
2.  **Continuous Testing & Monitoring**: Moving beyond one-off audits to regular, automated checks of the live product across all platforms, including **native mobile apps** and email funnels.
3.  **Culture of Excellence**: Building a sustainable internal culture through **user testing with disabled people** and continuous learning programs to build organizational empathy.

### AI-Powered Remediation with MCP Servers
A highlight of the presentation is a live demonstration by Andy from **DQ**, showcasing the **Axe MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**. This technology brings the vast knowledge base of DQ University directly into the developer's coding environment (IDE). In the demo, an AI agent scans a local React application, identifies issues like missing **alt-text** and poor **color contrast**, and automatically applies code fixes. This "Analyze and Remediate" workflow allows developers to solve complex accessibility problems in minutes without leaving their workspace, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for accessible coding.

### Modernizing the Auditing Workflow
Bertram demonstrates the **Ali

Planned** platform, which seeks to replace the manual labor of taking screenshots and filling out spreadsheets. The tool allows for **multi-platform auditing** (Web, iOS, Android) and provides visual overlays for criteria like **focus order**, text magnification (200%), and interactive element states. By simulating assistive technology needs directly in the browser, the tool enables non-experts to conduct thorough audits. Crucially, it generates **shareable, developer-ready reports** that map issues directly to technical solutions, making the remediation loop much faster for engineering teams.

### Accessibility as a Universal Human Need
The talk concludes by reframing accessibility as a design challenge for our "future selves." Bertram points out that only 3% of disabilities are present at birth; the vast majority are acquired through accidents, illness, or simply the **aging process**. As society becomes increasingly digital, inaccessible services exclude a growing portion of the population. He emphasizes that while automation is powerful, the goal is **user-friendliness**, not just checkbox compliance. True success is achieved when an organization establishes an **operations model** that combines the right tools, skilled people, and a commitment to empathy-led design.

## Context

Marcel Bertram is a specialist in UX operations and design systems, currently associated with Ali

Planned, a firm that helps companies integrate accessibility into their business strategies. He is joined by Andy, a solution engineer from DQ (the creators of the industry-standard Axe accessibility engine). This talk is highly relevant given the increasing global regulatory pressure, such as the European Accessibility Act (EAA), which is forcing organizations to move beyond ad-hoc testing toward enterprise-wide standards. This session is particularly valuable for Product Managers, Lead Developers, and Design Ops professionals who are tasked with maintaining accessibility across large-scale, multi-platform digital products. It bridges the gap between high-level compliance requirements and the day-to-day technical reality of software development.
