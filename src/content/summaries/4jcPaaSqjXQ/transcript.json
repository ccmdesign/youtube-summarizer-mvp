  "fullText": "[music] Um, I'm going to welcome up uh Marcel Bertram up to the stage. Um, this is this is going to be interesting. Well, I mean, first of all, Marcel is is part of Alip Planned um who's our sponsor here. Um this is a company helping organizations approach accessibility as a pragmatic business strategy. He's very passionate about proving that accessibility is both feasible and valuable which I think you know we can all stand behind but sometimes have a tough time you know uh actually making the case for. His talk is called uh accessibility that scales and is all about the real workflows tools and planning that lead to efficient sustainable accessible practices. because accessibility isn't really just about compliance. It's about having a practical way forward. So with that, I want to welcome Marcel to the stage. Hey Marcel, >> hey there. Thank you very much for the introduction. Hope everything works. Welcome. >> Yeah, it's great to be here at the Smashing Meets. Uh I was always always following a smashing conference especially with regards to accessibility. So really great and excited to be here. and uh talk a little bit also about my personal experience with accessibility. >> Excellent. We're so stoked to have you here. So, we're we're looking forward to it. So, let's check for the slides. Perfect. So, I hope you can see the slides now. Uh so thanks for being here once again. So my name is Masar Bacham. Um I used to be uh in the field of product management for design systems for quite a long time in large scale companies. Uh so it's always been a fan of systematic approaches and having tools and skills to yeah um empower people in large organizations with specific topics and race equality. also [snorts] later on with regards to accessibility and I'm always been quite a long time in the field of UX design and design operations. So also being a lot into finding standards and helping people other people to understand topics and also uh bring them to life with actual action plans and methods and tools. And also brought um a guest with me. that you will uh jump in later for a demonstration um because you will see like it's really essential that you have great toolings and support with your workflow that will support you in a personal case and also of course in a large scale organization to bringing in the race the topic. But first uh of all um I like to want to start with uh my personal story uh how I got approached with the topic of easy uh accessibility. Uh so basically um I can still remember the time it was a Friday. Uh I completed all of my tasks um not being really into the topic of accessibility already. So being in the design systems and UX operation topics and completed all of my tasks and then uh suddenly uh another email I got into the inbox with um a lot of pressure, a lot of priority and it was basically a lawsuit about accessibility um that with the organization came in and we have to or we were expected to getting some answers for this very very heavy uh lawsuit and a lot of documents like 105 pages to read through um and get a response um within one hour. So this was my first starting point with the topic of accessibility. So what was my first doings still on a Friday? I first had to look up what is actually accessibility about and then I found out a lot of laws, a lot of standards and then additional a lot of criteria are very complex longlasting heavily documented criteria lists and additionally also checklists a lot of diverse checklist to-dos uh best practices to try to manage all of these topics. So a lot of information um that I found out and actually it did not really help uh my my um my feeling about accessibility and the being afraid what to actually do about this. Then the second one, what do we actually have to do? So if you have a look in the legislation, especially in different countries in Germany, so I'm located in Germany. Um the legislation usually then reference to criteria to um be compliant, but they also add some additional obligations that you have to usually comply with. So you have to do continuous testing, not just once and then you're done. You have to test for multiple platforms, not just web touch points. for example, also emails, PDF documents or native apps as well. And you just not have to test some pages, but you have to completely test journeys, check out uh funnels, a lot of different samples. And very critical, you have to document everything. So you have to be easily able to share and prove what you actually did and what the results are. So next step was what happens uh still on the Friday if we do not comply with the law and again a lot of uh countries have um specific legislations but usually everything is tied up with fines that you probably have to pay for if you do not comply with accessibility. Some authorities especially in Germany it's also possible if you do not do anything about accessibility they basically stop you from offering your services. So you have to shut down your shop for example if you do not do anything uh until you complete the the problems and I also found out um even in some countries it's the possibility uh that you have to go to jail uh if you do not complete and comply with the legislation of accessibility and it's a raising topic um remember I received this email in my inbox and this was my first thoughts on accessibility and what actually I should do. So, well, um, we probably have to do something. I don't want to go to jail. Um, and wait, I don't want to pay any fines. So, start with some testing. Let's try to find out where we are. So, what we actually did uh back then um did some research, go through the checklist and found out that you have some possibilities with your devices, with your browsers. So there are native settings in the browser. You can um enlarge the typography, the scale, you can use assistive technologies like voice over. Of course, you have to learn how you actually um use these technologies and you really have to be careful because in my first try when using voice over, I actually blocked out myself from my iPhone. I had to talk and call to the Apple support. >> Will comment by voice over? >> Yeah. You have to get used to these topics. It's not easy, especially if you're new into this field and you have a lot of pressure on the other side from a lawsuit or legal regulations and your management, whoever wants something from you. And then we have this very complex checklists you have usually with this checklist associated additional tools. So for every kind of criteria, for every kind of check, you get some browser extensions, you get some explanations what kind of tools you should use, you have to facilitate and then there is actually also for these new tools there literally existing guides to guidelines. So there is some explanation how to actually manage this checklist and how to manage a test and this is definitely not easy and not scalable at all. And then last but not least, if you manage kind of to test your applications at some point, there's still the problem and we had to do some reportings for legislation for the management. How do I document uh all the stuff? So we started with powerpoints, we started with Excels copying over screenshots all over the files in order to manage this. And this is definitely not valuable and also not easy and feasible as a workflow. So the fundamental problem that I realized when being approached to accessibility in large scale organizations also in a personal projects and later on also with consulting other companies and uh freelancers have been always the same thing. It's a very complex topic. If you especially if you uh start with the topic of accessibility usually paired with missing skills because it's a really technical topic as well. A lot of different tools you never used before and it's definitely usually with a not easy approach. So you do not have the tools. If you have tools, they're kind of complex and the process and the approach is definitely not standardized and easy to apply both for you as a personal individual in your role as well as for complete teams and large scale organizations. So to sum it up also with us no skills, no tools actually no chance of yeah managing the topic of accessibility especially not with an ease. So what is the plan? What did we change? How do we approach this topic? And how did we set standards that we yeah follow also now uh in an a mature organization as well as then with the consultation of different companies to follow the same starting testing is definitely a very good beginning. So you should always start with testing and know where you are so that you directly can start fixing some stuff. But in order to be sustainably um accessible, you need to have improvements across the entire workflow and also across different roles in your organization of the product development workflow. So not just in the production try to find problems in production but also think of how we can spread the responsibility [clears throat] of accessibility across the complete development workflow. And so the master plan how we actually manage uh the topic of accessibility is usually split up in three phases. First one is about preventing issues being pushed to the live product by having enough tools and methods and capabilities for development accompanying testing. So find issues, fix issues during design and development or automatically check that you do not release um this kind of topics. Then in the middle part we have to test continuously the full scope and also um implement some kind of monitoring with easily sharable reports for internal organization as well as for authorities. And then in order to build an excellence culture, sustainable culture, we also need to consider what Michelle already mentioned like from EX perspective, we need to include the people that are affected with user testing and we also need to have continuous uh support for having learning uh capabilities and possibilities for our organization and for ourselves. So the first part for preventing issues and that's what we learned like with the partnership with DQ and like with our company we have a really good and we're really proud to partner with DQ as there are long uh lasting time here in this field of accessibility and we realize in the first field is really important for preventing issues and try to find and fix issues as early as possible in the development cycle. So not just if you ship them in the production but already in the designing and development phase because then it's like real figures you can save really a lot of money and also a lot of hassles and pains like when fixing uh the topics later on in the development workflow and what is really important in this part that you have to already include the design phase um I thought it's not really mandatory not really required and much of a value because it's additional effort for designers for example but it's really important also for the understanding like considering that you annotate very common problems already in design so the designers annotate for example image descriptions they annotate labelings or alternative labelings they annotate structure of the page headings and also for example for really complex interaction elements for example a keyboard board and the interactivity ordering and status announcements. So if designers keep track of this and include this already in the designs that they hand over to the development also with the support of easy plugins that support you with that and not additional efforts and then developers if they grab this they see this information maybe they think about it what is actually this topic is for and you you really have great possibilities to write avoid more problems in the creation workflow. Second part then after the handover is also really important and we realize that that developers already have enough tools and great capabilities to already check and their source code in the flow in the tool where they actually working. So if you're working in your IDE and you write code then you should directly have the possibility to get annotated if you um probably are not aware of infusing a problem and also with your local test sub with your local environment with extensions. It should be also easily possible in a large scale for every individual to test your built application for accessibility issues get directly annotated and then also have a better understanding for potential problems. So you also have the learning curve and uh you probably as a developer will avoid this kind of problems in the future because you get learned and get used to these topics and will not repeat that. And a a really great thing about this is um that DQ with the XMCP server recently um developed and probably will soon uh release this to the public um an MCP server that brings all of this trusted resources uh like the knowledge base of 20 years of experience with accessibility into your personal development environment also with an AI support to find and fix accessibility issues very accurately. So not with a general um like knowledge base of all around the world but like with the very specific knowledge base of the Q of this learning and you get fast and very direct responses to very special context questions for your product without breaking the flow. So without moving out of your actual development workflow and without of the tooling and um to showcase you this a little bit better um I brought um Andy um so I will hand over to you Andy because you prepared a short demonstration because I think this is the most valuable thing if we actually can see how this is working and not just showing some uh slides about Hello. Hello. Can you guys hear me >> now? Yes. Okay. Sorry. Sorry for >> now. It's working. Yes. Perfect. >> Perfect. So, uh hello again. Sorry for the delay. I'm a solution engineer at DQ. Today I'm going to show you a brief video um um a brief demo of how MCP server works. I have here built an application on React. I have gone ahead and launched a live demo for this one. Um, now I just use the dev tools extension for DQ just to see the accessibility issues that we have here. And without touching the code, I'm going to go back to the ID. So, um, the MCP server is already configured in cursor. We have two tools available. One analyze and remediate which is trained with a DQ university experience in accessibility. I'm going to use a prompt uh with uh the cursor in agent mode and I'm going to say use the analyze tool of the MCP server to scan the local host 3533 which is the website that I showed before to check for all the accessibility issues and then run the remediate tool. The remediate tool what is going to do is give expert advice to cursor and the agent itself on what is the issue, why is this issue happening and how to fix the issue. So right now we can see that the analyze tool is being run which uh it's just a wrap around the extension that we use the same extension and the ax core uh behind it to scan the web page for all the accessibility issues and once the analyze has been done is communicating everything to the remediate tool. So the remediate tool assembles everything from the issues that the analyze found. For example, what is uh the description of the issue? Why is it occurring? For example, as we saw before, we had some alt task alt text missing from the images. And now once um the issue has been found and we had the remediation for it, we are going to go ahead and as you can see reviewing the code and applying directly the fixes. Um once uh this uh is done, we're going to go back into the web page that we saw and we're going to do a recon again with the with the extension just to confirm that all the accessibility issues uh have been done. As you can see now, it's applying the the fixes uh reviewing the JavaScript code, the CSS, the skeleton, etc. Once it's done, as you can see by the script, I said that you have to reanalyze everything to make sure that all the issues have been taken care of. And once all the remediation has been done, it's checking for linting errors. For example, if there is an issue in the code or anything else that might be done and it's running the reanalyze again once everything uh has been done and it has been I think like two or three minutes since uh I initially run the prompt, we can see the summary of all the issues that have been fixed. For example, we had uh nine issues, nine issues in um alt attributes. We had the button color contrast and also link names. And we go here. You can see the issues here. 882. And we're going to do a recon like this. Everything it's fixed. That's uh my part. Thank you. Thank you very much Andy. >> Welcome. >> I think this one is really really um impressive and um yeah what I wanted to point out here as well like you have to start very early. So as much as possible uh you can find and fix issues early in the stage the less problems you will get of course with the findings in the actual product uh environment or the life environment and the really cool thing especially like with this technologies of MCP the assistance and you have the possibilities to do this stuff directly in your workflow. So no additional uh stuff, no changing of toolings, no changing of workflows is also supporting the efficiency and definitely also the understanding because you get directly annotations about the code, your real context and you also have the possibility to ask questions and then have also some some assistance to you to have a better understanding for this topic. But um it's also very heavily related to um the development um cycle. So then the the second part if you remember our master plan when we try to prevent issues from becoming live you probably do not have the full possibility of directly finding and fixing all of the uh problems. So we also have to continuously and especially with larger releases test the real product product. So the live product with the full scope of the criteria and make the documentation so the findings easily accessible, sharable and understandable both for the teams as a task list to work on and also as a reporting tool for authorities or the management for example. And this was also the starting point uh of our company like we we thought that the the auditing workflow especially for continuous testing for um checking all of the criteria finding the right criteria having the right assistance with the toolings is really complex as I told you and showed you in the beginning uh so that we said okay let's let's improve this workflow like the end to end workflow of doing this audit that's being guided have the right toolings assistings available and directly generate um the reports and that's how we basically came up uh with our tooling that I shortly want to showcase you and then hopefully later on give you the possibility to explore this by an invitation on [snorts] your own. Um so the idea is that it's quite easy to create um accessibility audits. So for example, if you want to check our easy meets um website, you're able to um directly select the criteria. This is one of the first steps we had to learn about um that it's directly mapped to the platform. It's preparing for you. So you don't have to check for this and it's directly then applied to the testing phase at the end. you have the possibility because it's required to te test different platforms in one tool. So not just web applications but also native applications or emails for example. And then like when defining the scope, it's kind of easy to set up what you want to test like based on URLs or maybe adding some actions because you want to test some checkout funnels or some very complex interactions. then you can set up the the auditing scope that you want to test and um start a first run. Um because as you remember accessibility is also not just a one-time project for testing but usually like you have to continuously test and go through different uh scopes and also like showcasing the progress. For example, the first audit was a a lot of issues. second audit um a little bit less issues and then you also can prove and showcase and um yeah share this insights to whole organization about the actual progress of this auditing. So if you start um an audit then it's running through the actual application and once it's done and there's a second project here what you can do now like I selected the criteria you see all of the pages that are um part of the auditing scope and the really cool thing about this it also runs some automatic checks for example here with the color contrast stuff it directly detects that this element here got a problem with color contrast it direct actually annotates this in the screenshot in the context with some HTML annotation and with the right um criteria and [snorts] for all of the other rules um that you have to check for we really support um this topics for example with images for every rule you get directly highlights of the relevant elements that you have to check for for example here with the images and then with some additional information Here for example the alternative description we directly see this um as part of this rule check. So what is relevant for this criteria is that the alternative description is descriptive for people with assistive technologies. So you can directly find this here and in case there is a problem easily annotate the problem do some AI generation and then directly annotate the problem here in this specific criteria and such like with this rule for all the other rules we also have some support in this so that you directly can see in the tool you do not need some assistive technologies no guiding guides uh no browser extensions whatever everything that is relevant for this ind individual needs in the criteria is directly simulated in the tool and you can easily then find problems and annotate some problems for example here with the text magnification 200% text zoom that this one is for example a problem and same applies also um to other criteria just like the focus order visualized here very easy to follow if there is a problem if any element is missing or also for example the focus state itself. So is every element that should have a focus state also with a visual focus indicator like here with the menu or not directly see this without need the need of tabbing all through the application and then find the problems and make it take some screenshots putting into a PowerPoint and then share it with others because if you do some annotations here just as I did it um you have an easy and direct summary of the uh reports of the annotations that you can share within your team and of course share publicly with authorities that are requesting for your current status. And if you already checked of all of the criteria and all of the affected pages and the cool thing about this also with topics of understanding and raising the awareness for the topics, the context is really important. So not just having a list of problems without any further information where this actually occurs, what a problem is about and how you can fix this because you directly h get with the sharing reports also these annotations. So without need of taking screenshots this element with the problem description, the solution description any specific element and you for example also can export this to a task management or complete tasks directly in the tooling and a cool thing uh about this um so smashing is also infused here. So you can find here the same things for example um the focus states maybe have to be optimized here um or the continue button for example because it's not clearly visible and also here the readability in the focus state is not the best one. So quite quite easy straightforward to find some problems and share this and then again with the team to fix this do another run and then um have a very easy possibility to remediate remediate this uh stuff. And last but not least you also remember we have to check all the different platforms. Most of the companies that we are working for also have some native applications. With native applications we had the same problem. How do you actually test this? How to document it? Because you have a different device um and you have to somehow bring it into a report taking snapshots, screenshots, whatever. So the cool thing about our approach is that we want to be multiplatform so that it's also possible for example um to audit native applications, upload applications and run them from the app store and then do the same and have the same approach of um for example um having directly the screenshots having the different modes. So seeing if text zoom for example is working or not and then directly annotate the problems also for applications in one platform different teams and share this findings very straightforward um with your organization. So this is um basically the second part where you put a lot of effort in making this process of actually running audits um straightforward and very easy especially also for people that are not really experts about accessibility. So we do not have to explain how to use the inspect mode in the browser console, how to uh set up these different modes and how to use screen reader technologies in the first set because all of the relevant information is directly easily uh accessible in as part of the audit workflow and can then directly be reported and shared. But this is just this second part. It's also really important part. So development accompanying testing annotating problems in design try to find and fix things in development and then uh run complete audits from the live applications native and web applications. But the last part and really important part from the longlasting sustainable approach is the need of having a shared understanding and responsibility across the organization. And this only can be done if you're actually applying and including people that are affected as well. So it's really important that you know um about the technologies by doing a self- testing run voice over technologies on your own device run some simulations and doing research. try to learn more about actual application of different kind of technologies, the existence of different ex um assistive technologies. I also been part of quite a lot of user testing and every user testing I learn more about different um yeah requirements different ways of using digital applications and I always want to reflect this and also have a better understanding for what we are actually doing and what um it is about the topic of accessibility and then of course continuous learning learning learning offering activities offering possibilities for the organization to continously learn and also learn in the context of the actual application. So we for example as a company run individual row specific trainings for example for web developers for app developers because we realized that the understanding how to actually apply fix stuff and also directly build accessible code. it can only be done uh when telling the people how to actually do this and what to take care of and also with the assistance um as Andi was presenting like with the MCP there also great other tools also offered for example by the Q highly recommended university the learning course there that you have the possibility of selfarnings at a time you want to where you have some time and also the the possibility to have someone to chat with like with the X assistant to really have someone to ask specific questions about accessibility and get an immediate response and help on this and of course user testing. Um so I really have to say the first thing uh I I I was attending user testing is empathy. So really empathy for the people how they actually using it and I also learned why we have this kind of criteria and why we should implement and take care of this not just for the criteria itself but it's for people and that they have a better or even have the possibility of using our applications. So to sum this up, after running some tests or joining some user testing, doing some research, I have to say like definitely fear got us started with the topic of accessibility. It was a lawsuit that pushed us in um raising the awareness for accessibility, start doing something but understanding the empathy for the people and for the topic and especially the ease of use. So having tools and workflows that help us to easily run audits to easily find problems to fix audits and also to easily get some responses directly when we need them. They kept us going and they keep us motivated in still investing and doing something about accessibility. And I want to close up this talk um not with checklists and u toolings but like with the topic of accessibility. So accessibility is and always has been about people and not just about completing checklists. And you have to keep in mind like if you run these checks, if you do some audits, they are really good. They are mandatory and necessary, but things still can be um compliant but not user friendly to the people that are directly affected by the things that we want to um want to do and that we are doing. And you also has to keep in mind accessibility affects all of us. So we're getting older. Everyone of us getting is getting older. Me as well as I have a bright future for me. Um and already right now we have a really high digitalization. So we digit digitalizing all of our processes, restaurants, orderings, um shopping, every every kind of process gets sooner or later digitalized. But we also getting older and um old becoming old is a really really high aspect of accessibility and making content maybe not accessible for everyone [snorts] and it's not just a niche topic. So there are a lot of people with permanent disabilities living around the world in the EU or just also around the world. And also really important part is that only 3% of um disabilities are there from birth. So a lot of disabilities develop over time. So sooner or later every one of us could be affected and we also building this topic and this stuff for ourselves. So what helped us actually with making um accessibility more efficient and sustainable in general for ourselves and for the organization is to make it clear and make it easy for everyone. So not just having some niche experts taking care of accessibility but we need to have kind of an operation model in our organization or for ourselves. And what is important therefore is of course the awareness and the responsibility. We have to take care of accessibility want to do something about accessibility and we also need to have the empathy for the actual value of of accessibility which is not fulfilling legal requirements but doing something for the people. we need to have or the essence of success for us was to have the right tools that are easy to use and they also really important easy to use for everyone for designers, product managers, developers. So really it's important to have standardized tools that are easy to use and of course we need the people and especially skilled people. So we have to invest in the trainings, we have to do the learnings and we have to provide this kind of stuff and also with some assistance um so that people can build uh up these required skills for accessibility and this should be like the frame for the complete development cycle, development workflow of building virtual products and experiences from design over development doing some audits doing some testing test things, doing some research and also doing monitorings and um ensuring documentation and tracking the success and the progress and then do this over as a loop. Learn from what possible problems we have and then put this again into the development cycle and try to improve this continuously and not just doing it one time and then stop um actually taking care of accessibility. And then hopefully with the next time that you get, fingers crossed, not a lawsuit, but maybe a request from some affected person with disability or maybe some of your managers asking you for the state of accessibility. You are well prepared. You did follow the process. You have some readym made documentation that you easily can share and um yeah you basically have everything at place for following and directly applying accessibility with ease and um yeah that's the end of my talk what I brought up you so I always really appreciate getting in contact with all of you also after the call um so if you are open feel free to connect uh on LinkedIn um and then let's chat about your challenges about some further experiences around the topic of accessibility and of course on the other side what I also brought to you we want to make accessibility also easy for you whether you're a freelancer in a personal plan working on accessibility building designing some stuff or you are part of a large scale enterprise um we already brought you some kind of a gift package. So if you want to explore the toolings, the stuff that I just showcased right now, you can go on this landing page or scan the QR code and then easily can sign up and explore this on your end. Well, geez, Marcel, Andy, thank you so much for the presentation and demo. Um, I think this is really helpful. Um especially when we consider like what easy means when it comes to to accessibility. It's nice to know that we have these tools that can help um at least on the automated side of of uh of this and like how to see how communication can can be facilitated how this can like bridged disciplines um together too. Um, one uh one question that that popped up um in the chat while while you were talking is whether uh the Figma MCP server is able to read X annotations. Do you know if that's if that's possible? >> So, um under my current knowledge at the moment, no. But I'm pretty sure there can be some workarounds done between the Axe MCP and also Vigma MCP. Um, I've taken already this uh question back to product team and uh I'm pretty sure we're going to have a proper feedback soon. >> Very cool. Thank you. And uh and also when it comes to to testing a site um does it have to be a public URL or can you know get get past like a password protected staging or development environment? Uh so for Ellie plan for the tool it's also possible to access restricted pages of course in testing environments or some other general restrictions. Um so it's easily possible to also check for this pages for productive pages and of course for the DQ toolings um or other development accompanying testing you can also of course easily check this on your local uh staging environment or whatever you are building the applications. >> Thank you. Uh, you know, it the remediation feature in the tool was so stinking impressive and cool. Um, uh, and and it seems like it it would do a really good job of surfacing issues right there in the development process. Is there anything that that automated process might not cover that that a developer would want to be aware of? So uh at the moment as I mentioned during the demo um the remediation tool it's like uh a re a wrapping of the extension that we have. The extension does uh the full scanning using playright and other um automated frameworks but also has um IGTS which are intelligent guided testing which is an interaction between a human and also AI to do more than just automated testing. At the moment we are focused only on the automating automating uh part of the process and very soon it's already on the road map. We're going to do the advanced models for intelligent guided testing which is going to cover more like tab uh spacing um al image uh name generation uh model uh functionality among other um other tools that we have. >> Very cool. Thank you. And one more thing here. Um, you know, know a tool like this, I'm trying to like think towards uh towards what Michelle's presentation was talking about as well, how, you know, we want to probably get into the browser faster and test earlier um and not worry so much about being perfect because perfect can hold up the the process too. this tool. It It almost seems like designers have to know a lot upfront to um to actually define and document and annotate a a design and then developers get to, you know, get to lean on an on this automated tool. Like what's the what's the responsibility of developers to to also prevent these these issues from from popping up in the first place? And how does a tool like this uh help facilitate the design process in addition to the development process? >> So it's a question for me or Marcel. Go ahead Marcel. >> Yeah. So I I think um like especially these tools are setting standards for on the one hand actually doing something about it and they really support you also like I have a lot of experience with large scale organization. It really helps if you have unified standards across the different teams because the collaboration is made easier and also like explaining people what to actually do is also way easier and like the the annotation of things like with these plugins you get really a good support. Some of the the tools already bring some automations about this. And the cool thing about this um is also like the the raising of awareness for specific topics because we realized some of designers never heard of um alternative description of status messages and all of this stuff. And you get guided by the tool to take care of these topics. And maybe you read about what is this actually about. What is the keyboard order? Why is this important? And the same what applies here for designers is also the same with developers. If you have some tools that support you is also really a good thing uh to raise the awareness for the specific topics and also for what you have to take care and like these tools then push in the beginning to to raise the awareness for accessibility. But we also realized later on um at some point that um the the the actual problems decrease because the the developers directly know what they have to do because they did a lot of annotations. They did a lot of testing during the development cycle and through that they learn really a lot and also communicate with each other like from design to the developer handoff. >> Yeah. And I also want to know, and I'm sure lots of other people do too, what happened with the lawsuit? Everything okay there? >> Yes, it was uh basically I did not annotate it here. It was the first one was really not about money. It was about the actual topic of building up an accessibility plan. That's also the the the naming of our company. And uh it was really enforced that we do development accompanying testing that we do manual audits that we run user testing and that we also take and annotate some responsible people in the organization. Uh so it actually really helped us. We had to do some frequent reportings on that. We could also manage this with the support of the right toolings and it was basically also kind of um a gift to get pushed into this topic >> here at Smashing Meets. I look forward to bring you back up during the panel discussion. And uh you know before we jump into a third uh talk here, we're going to take a little 5minut break or so. We all need to stretch our legs. Um I need to get more coffee because you don't want to see me uh uncaffeinated. And uh you know, we'll we'll come right back and pick this up uh right where we leave off here.",
