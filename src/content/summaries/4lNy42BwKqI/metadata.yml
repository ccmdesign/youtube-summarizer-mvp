  Welcome back and happy new year!

  In this episode, dive into Apple's new multi-year partnership with Google, which will see Google's Gemini AI technology power key Apple features, including a significant upgrade to Siri. 

  I analyze the implications for both companies and the larger AI market, and discuss reactions from industry figures like Elon Musk. We also explore OpenAI's new health product, chat about Claude's latest release for non-technical users, and cover new features in Google's AI inbox for Gmail. Additionally, we touch on Tailwind's economic challenges due to AI agent adoption and reveal insights from a study on AI agents in coding.
