  "fullText": "So, after a disastrous couple of years, has Apple finally admitted defeat? This week, Apple and Google announced a major multi-year partnership, which will see Google's Gemini power Apple's AI features, including a major new Siri upgrade that is due for release later this year. So, in this video, we're going to take a look at what this might mean for Apple, for Google, and also for the wider AI market, too. Plus, OpenAI has revealed a new health product, but do you really trust that company with your health data? And a major new release from Claude sees the company try to build upon its billiondoll cash cow, Claude Cord, by adapting it to non-technical use cases. So, we got all that coming up in this slightly revamped version of the briefing. And as always, if you do enjoy the channel, then hit the subscribe and the like button. So this week, Apple and Google formally announced a new partnership that will see Gemini become Apple's model for powering products like Siri. In a post from Google, they say that after careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple models and that it's excited about the new innovative experiences that it will unlock for Apple users. So, if we strip away some of the PR spin here, it looks as though Apple has finally admitted what we all suspected after their botched 2024 launch, and that is that right now at least, it can't build its own foundational AI models at a competitive scale. For a company that has spent decades building this narrative that it makes everything better in house, particularly after the impressive development of their M series MacBook chips, they seem to have publicly acknowledged that their AI efforts are insufficiently capable to compete. Apple has been bleeding AI talent over the past few months. And as always, the clock is ticking down to the next WWDC. And so it's understandable why they might do this because Apple needs something impressive to announce this year. For Apple in 2026, this makes strategic sense. Why should they bother wasting even more time and money building something inhouse when other companies have already built the technology they need? In many ways, this echoes Apple's previous decisions with search, maps, and Intel chips. This is a defeat only in the sense that they were originally trying to do it all themselves, but they were failing at it. Admitting defeat and partnering with Google is probably a much smarter approach for now, at least. For Google, it's pretty much a win-win as they're set to bag an extra $1 billion in revenue, which is pretty much a drop in the ocean to those guys. But more importantly, they get to prove to the market that they are now the leading AI model maker. The company's stock price is up 7% at the time of recording, which is hardly surprising. But not everyone is thrilled. Elon Musk has called the news an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, particularly given that they already have Android and Chrome. Competition authorities may be inclined to agree. For OpenAI, though, this is a potential body blow. Back in 2024, Apple chose to integrate its AI features with chat GPT, but this decision seems to reflect the perception that Gemini is now the model to beat. It's also worth remembering that since 2024, Johnny IV has teamed up with Sam Alman to develop a new piece of hardware. And whilst this is pure speculation on my behalf, perhaps this defection by Johnny Iive to OpenAI also left a bitter taste in the mouth of Apple execs. The partnership gives Apple the ability to speed up the development of new AI features by piggybacking on top of Google's foundational models, which buys itself some time to develop its own models. Apple Intelligence was definitely a failure, but was that because the technology was awful, or was it because of a failure of product market fit? The question that I keep thinking about is, do users even want these powerful AI features baked into their operating systems like Apple previously did with Apple intelligence, or do they prefer AI assistants to live inside some sort of dedicated app? With this new partnership with Google, Apple now has some time to find out, and it'll be fascinating to see what Apple cooks up for Apple Intelligence 2.0. zero. What do you think? Will Apple build a new set of AI features that users actually want to use this time around or has the damage already been done even with the help of Google? Let me know in the comments below. And speaking of some new features that users may potentially not want, Google itself has announced a new AI inbox which gives users a radical alternative to a traditional inbox. So this is an AI inbox that sits above the original inbox inside the Gmail navigation. So you can see from this screenshot that this is a clear hierarchal decision that suggests that Google thinks that this should take precedence over a traditional inbox. The UI consists of suggested to-do items from the day and summaries from your most important emails. At the same time, Google has confirmed that is making other AI features like suggested replies, AI overviews, and help me write tools all free to users after previously only being available as paid features. Google's VP of product for Gmail posted a video on LinkedIn outlining these features and he says that Gmail is now in its Gemini era. So, this AI inbox certainly feels like a potentially helpful feature. But what happens if the daily overview misses something important? On one hand, I can see how Google's AI inbox makes strategic sense. Your email contains your receipts, your relationships, your commitments, your entire transactional history. So, it is arguably more valuable than your search history for understanding intent and action. Google has had this data for over 20 years, but up until this point, it hasn't really extracted much intelligence from it beyond spam filtering, but on the other hand, I don't think I'd ever feel particularly comfortable relying on a summarized version of my inbox to bring me up to speed with my most important items for the day. I'm sure I'd find AI inbox useful and maybe perhaps even too useful, but I just worry that I become reliant on it and then miss some important emails. Google execs will be starting the year happy about the performance of Gemini products. A new data released this week seems to justify that. According to this freshly published data from similar web, chat GBT has lost a further 4% in AI traffic share while Google has increased its share to over 20%. Now these stats are only for the web and so it's worth caveating that because as we know lots of people access AI assistance through mobile apps. So I'm guessing the data is a lot different when you factor in mobile devices. But they do put OpenAI's pre Christmas code red into more context. And speaking of chat GPT, they've kicked off their 2026 with their first major launch of the year by launching a new subproduct called chat GPT health. Based on the UI, you can see that health is a separate section within chat GPT that you access from the sidebar menu. It has its own conversation history, its own memories, and its own connected apps that are all walled off from regular Chat GPT apps. And in the launch notes, they mention a framework called the Healthbench framework, which emphasizes the clinical safety behind all this. And it looks as though this is the groundwork for selling chat GBT into healthcare providers. OpenAI CEO of apps Fiji shared her own experience with using the app for health and she says that 230 million users are currently asking it about health related questions. But the question for OpenAI is whether users themselves trust the company with their own health data. OpenAI is hardly the most trusted company in the world, at least in tech circles. But perhaps the wider public just won't care so much. Elsewhere this week, Claude has unveiled a major new product. It's calling cowwork, which it describes as Claude code for the rest of your work. So, the background here is that Anthropic noticed that developers were essentially using Claude Code for repurposing non-coding tasks. That's things like vacation research, slide decks, email cleanup, organizing photos, and so on. And Claude Code's co-creator, Boris Churnney, said that users were doing all sorts of non-coding work. So, Anthropic did what good product teams do. listened to the shadow use case and built an offering around it. The implementation of this makes it much easier to use. So you don't have to go through the terminal. You can instead use a desktop app and it also integrates with existing connectors. So things like notion, Gmail, Asana and so on. Anthropic engineers reportedly built this entire product in approximately 10 days and of course they use claude code to do it. Some of the use cases outlined by anthropic in cowwork include things like creating files, crunching data, making prototypes, and organizing files. So in this example, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer, and then Claude will organize those files into a spreadsheet. These use cases were already available in Claude, but by repackaging this offering into a less intimidating tool that lives in the terminal, Claude Code is hoping that it it can build upon the $1 billion revenue run rate that it achieved back in December. And while we're on the topic of Claude, Claude projects is also a feature that's often overshadowed by other tools like Claude Code and the newly released Skills, which is now set to become an open standard for the industry. What many people don't realize though is that you can actually combine projects with features like Skills to build powerful reusable systems at work. And in this week's knowledge series over on Substack, I explain how you can use Claw projects to monitor the health of your business. I talk you through how you can use Claude projects to monitor health indications like user data, value proposition, new X health, and more. So, if you're interested in learning more about how you might be able to use Claude projects at work, then check out that over on Substack. Now, let's move on to some data and trends for the week. And we'll start with the story of Tailwind. So, this is a story. This is an insight into the unintended economic consequences of using AI agents. The CSS framework Tailwind says that it has laid off 75% of its engineering team simply because it became too popular with AI agents. So essentially this destroyed its primary upsell channel which is where users would visit their documentation to find out more about their commercial offerings and then upgrade to a paid package. The docs were the only way for people to find out about their commercial offerings. But AI agents don't read docs in the same way as humans do and ultimately they don't care about commercial upsells. The company says that traffic to docs is down 40% and revenue is down a massive 80%. So this is shaping up to be a brutal but fascinating insight into the second order consequences of AI agent adoption. This is definitely something for product teams who are reliant on similar upsell mechanics to consider. And continuing the theme of AI agents, which is a pretty heavy focus for this week, a new study shows that engineers actually do enjoy working with AI agents for coding with some important caveats. So in this study, enjoyment was measured on a six-point scale, which compared coding with agents versus coding without. The average score overall was 5.1, which is actually really high, indicating that developers generally felt pleased or extremely pleased. But there was one important caveat. Working with AI agents was enjoyable so long as engineers remained in control and were able to thoroughly review its output. So, this is a fascinating new study that looks at how engineers actually work with AI agents and more importantly what they think about it. So, check that one out. I'll put the link to that in the description. And 2026 looks to be the year that the adoption of AI agents starts to explode. So, McKenzie's global manager said last week that by the end of the year, he expects the company to have as many personalized AI agents as employees, but that the overall headcount of the company won't necessarily decrease. So if you put this into context, McKenzie actually has over 40,000 employees. So technically that is over 40,000 AI agents that are set to be deployed into production this year. So instead of reducing their overall employee headcount, the company is reconfiguring its employee composition. But it looks like some work is getting automated hard while other work, in this case client relationships and judgments calls is becoming more valuable. And finally this week, if you are interested in learning more about what the hottest jobs in the world are, LinkedIn has published its new jobs on the rise report, which is definitely worth a read. Perhaps unsurprisingly, AI engineers have taken the top spot with AI consultants and strategists in second, and most of the people in the role in that role transitioned into it from product management. So, I'll put the link into the description to that if you want to read more. And on that note, thanks very much for listening and watching. I'll be back next week with another briefing.",
