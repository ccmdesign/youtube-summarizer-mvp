  For years, designers have been told to trust the process.
  Research first. Personas. Journey maps. Problem statements. Then solutions.
  
  In this talk from Hatch Conference, Jenny Wen, Design Lead at Anthropic and former Director of Design at Figma, explains why that model no longer fits the reality of modern design work.
  
  With AI accelerating prototyping, smaller teams doing more, and craft becoming a key differentiator, rigid processes are failing designers. Jenny shares real examples from Figma and Anthropic that show how great work actually gets made today. Starting from solutions, caring deeply about details, building intuition, skipping steps, and designing for delight.
  
  This is not a rejection of research or strategy.
  It is a call to stop worshipping process artifacts and start trusting designer judgment again.
  
  You will learn
  • Why the traditional design process breaks down in an AI driven world
  • How AI changes who prototypes and how fast teams move
  • Why craft, taste, and quality are becoming more important
  • When starting from a solution leads to better outcomes
  • How intuition is built and why it matters
  • Why great design often comes from breaking the rules

  Jenny Wen argues that rigid design processes are outdated in the AI era, where tools allow non-designers to prototype quickly and designers to code. To stay relevant, practitioners must:
  - Prioritize **craft and end-user experience** over process artifacts
  - Build **intuition** through constant feedback loops
  - Embrace **solution-first design** to leverage new technology capabilities.

## Key Takeaways

Jenny Wen (Design Lead at Anthropic, formerly Figma) argues that the standardized design process has become a liability that prioritizes strategy over quality.

* **Process vs. Outcome**: Users do not care about personas or journey maps; they care about the end experience. Designers often spend 80% of their time on **process artifacts** rather than the final craft.

* **The AI Shift**: AI is raising the "floor" of design. For designers to remain valuable, they must focus on **taste, curation, and quality**—elements that cannot be prompted.

* **Intuition as a Skill**: Intuition is not guessing; it is a **reasoned judgment shortcut** built by internalizing user feedback, data, and design principles.

* **Solution-First Design**: In the AI era, technology changes so fast that we must often build solutions first to understand what problems they can solve, rather than waiting for a problem statement.

## Summary

Jenny Wen highlights a growing disconnect between the traditional, rigid design process taught in schools and the reality of modern, high-speed product development. She argues that while the "Design Thinking" movement was necessary to give designers a "seat at the table," it has led to an over-reliance on steps like personas and brainstorming that often result in mediocre products. In the current landscape, influenced heavily by AI and leaner team structures, these rigid methods are no longer sufficient.

### The Impact of AI and Lean Teams
AI has democratized prototyping, allowing Product Managers to "vibe code" or create working models faster than designers can finish a journey map. This shift means designers must evolve from being "gatekeepers of the process" to being **experts in craft**. With fewer resources and smaller teams, the goal is now to "do more with more capabilities" rather than following a manual. Designers are now expected to be more **PM-shaped** (strategic) and **engineer-shaped** (implementing and prototyping).

### Moving Toward Solution-First Design
Wen challenges the "illegal" notion of starting with a solution. Using the development of **Claude Artifacts** at Anthropic as an example, she explains that sometimes the technology must be seen in action before the problem space is even understood. When technology evolves rapidly, designers should apply new capabilities backward to existing problems rather than waiting for a standard discovery phase. This requires a shift from being problem-centric to being **capability-centric**.

### Cultivating Intuition and skipping Steps
Great work often comes from **skipping steps** or inventing new ones. At Figma, instead of the traditional Amazon "press release" method, Wen’s team used a "tweet component" to imagine how users would react to a feature on social media. This made the process faster and more relevant to their specific audience. 

To facilitate this speed, designers must build **intuition**. Wen defines intuition as the ability to make fast, reasoned judgments by building an "internal world model" of the user. This is achieved by:

* Constantly reading user feedback on platforms like Reddit or Twitter.

* Attending research sessions outside of one's immediate project scope.

* Monitoring data dashboards to understand usage trends.

### The "Smile Test" and Ruthless Craft
Ultimately, the value of design lies in **delight and craft**. Wen cites the long tail of quality work done on Fig

Jam—iterating on border selection, colors, and font sizes—as work that doesn't fit into a "Double Diamond" diagram but defines the product's success. She encourages designers to trust themselves to "make people smile" rather than just checking off boxes in a process manual.

## Context

This talk comes at a pivotal moment in the design industry, following a period of massive layoffs and the rapid integration of generative AI. For years, the 'design process' was used as a tool for professional legitimacy. However, as AI lowers the barrier to creating visual assets and prototypes, the traditional 'Design Thinking' framework is being criticized for producing 'AI slop'—generic, uninspired software. This matters to any product professional who feels bogged down by corporate bureaucracy or is looking to leverage AI to move faster. It marks a shift in the industry's focus back toward 'craft' and 'taste' as the primary differentiators in a saturated market.
