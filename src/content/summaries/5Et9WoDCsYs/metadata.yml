  What's really happening with AI and business competition? The common story is that AI disrupts everything uniformly — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on how AI is bifurcating the economy:

   • Why mid-tier digital firms are getting crushed from both directions
   • How physical, local businesses are actually protected by AI economics
   • What three layers determine your competitive vulnerability
   • Where your AI investment should go based on your market position

  AI is commoditizing tokenizable cognition — drafting, analysis, coding — while judgment and physical execution become the binding constraints. A three-person team with AI tools now rivals a fifty-person agency, but no AI can show up at your house and fix your furnace.

  For leaders, the strategic opportunity is real — but only if you diagnose where your firm actually sits in this reshaped economy.
