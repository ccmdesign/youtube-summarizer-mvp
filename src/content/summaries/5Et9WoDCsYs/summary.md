    What's really happening with AI and business competition? The common story is that AI disrupts everything uniformly — but the reality is more complicated.


    In this video, I share the inside scoop on how AI is bifurcating the economy:


    \ • Why mid-tier digital firms are getting crushed from both directions

    \ • How physical, local businesses are actually protected by AI economics

    \ • What three layers determine your competitive vulnerability

    \ • Where your AI investment should go based on your market position


    AI is commoditizing tokenizable cognition — drafting, analysis, coding — while judgment and physical execution become the binding constraints. A three-person team with AI tools now rivals a fifty-person agency, but no AI can show up at your house and fix your furnace.


    For leaders, the strategic opportunity is real — but only if you diagnose where your firm actually sits in this reshaped economy.

## Key Takeaways

AI's economic impact depends heavily on market **contestability** and which specific layer of the value chain a business occupies.

* **The Three-Layer Map**: Businesses generate value through **Tokenizable Cognition** (now a cheap commodity), **Judgment and Accountability** (the human-led bottleneck), and **Physical Execution** (protected labor involving physical atoms).

* **The Middle-Tier Squeeze**: Professional service firms with 40-50 employees are the most vulnerable because they lack the cost-efficiency of 3-person AI teams and the distribution moats of giants.

* **Physical vs. Digital Markets**: AI is a massive tailwind for "atoms" businesses (plumbing, dentistry) by reducing overhead without exposing them to global competition.

* **Strategic Pivot**: To survive, digital firms must either become **radically lean** or move "up-stack" to sell high-judgment, accountability-driven results.

## Summary

The traditional narrative that AI simply replaces workers is overly simplistic. Instead, AI is reshaping the economy by collapsing the cost of **Tokenizable Cognition**—tasks like drafting, basic analysis, and coding that can be expressed in language. According to **Jevons Paradox**, when a resource like cognitive output becomes cheaper, we do not use less of it; instead, demand explodes, leading to a flood of digital content and analysis that requires human management.

### The Three-Layer Framework
To navigate this shift, leaders must view their operations through three layers. The first is the production layer (cognition), which AI has commoditized. The second is the **Judgment and Accountability** layer, where humans must still sign off on decisions and own the professional risk. The third is the **Physical Execution** layer, which involves physical labor in the real world. AI's inability to master the second and third layers creates new competitive bottlenecks.

### The Bifurcated Barbell Economy
This framework predicts a "barbell" economy. On one side are **Contestable Digital Markets** (marketing, software, design) where switching costs are low. Here, the middle tier is being crushed. These firms have too much legacy overhead to compete with hyper-efficient 3-person AI startups, yet they lack the massive distribution networks of industry giants. 

On the other side are **Physical/Local Markets** (trades, healthcare). In these sectors, AI acts as a pure efficiency tailwind. It automates scheduling and billing without making the core service—physically fixing a pipe or a tooth—more competitive. Consequently, these "atoms-based" businesses are seeing rising margins and relative protection from AI disruption.

### Strategic Investment Paths
For businesses in the digital middle, there are only two viable paths: get radically lean by rebuilding around a small AI-core team, or shift the business model to focus exclusively on high-judgment **Accountability**. For AI startups, the goal must be moving beyond simple token generation toward workflow orchestration and compliance. Meanwhile, industry giants must leverage their distribution moats while aggressively innovating internally to prevent talent drain to faster-moving startups. Standing still in the "middle" is no longer a viable strategy in a post-AI economy.

## Context

This framework addresses the 2026 economic reality where AI tools have saturated the market, making basic cognitive work a commodity. It matters because it explains why some sectors are seeing massive layoffs while others remain untouched, moving past the generic 'AI replaces everyone' fear-mongering. This connects to broader economic trends like **Baumol’s Cost Disease**, where physical services become relatively more expensive as digital productivity skyrockets. Business leaders and investors should care because it provides a diagnostic tool to identify which firms have a durable moat and which are 'endangered species' based on their position in the digital vs. physical value chain.
