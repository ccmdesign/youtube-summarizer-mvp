  What's really happening inside the AI infrastructure race at CES 2026? The common story is it's about flashy gadgets — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on why CES 2026 marks AI's shift from chip race to factory race:
  -Why NVIDIA's Rubin platform optimizes for inference token economics
  -How OpenAI secured 26 gigawatts across NVIDIA, AMD, Broadcom
  -What inference context memory reveals about AI scaling constraints
  -Where demand pressure creates multi-winner hardware landscape despite NVIDIA dominance

  01:09 - The Demand Shock: Inference Dominates Training 
  02:54 - NVIDIA's Rubin: Selling an AI Factory, Not Just GPUs 
  04:50 - Inference Context Memory: Managing the KV Cache 
  06:29 - OpenAI as Reference Customer: The Factory Blueprint 
  08:51 - OpenAI's Multi-Vendor Strategy: 26 Gigawatts of Capacity 
  10:24 - Memory Supply Chain: Samsung and SK Hynix Join Stargate 
  11:45 - DRAM Shortage: The Hidden Bottleneck 
  12:44 - Will Anyone Challenge NVIDIA's Dominance? 
  15:05 - Multi-Winner Reality: AMD, Broadcom, and Anthropic's TPUs 
  17:09 - Physical AI: From Data Centers to Robotics 
  18:07 - Conclusion: The Year AI Became a Factory

  The companies that locked supply chain deals in late 2025 — like OpenAI with Samsung, SK Hynix, and hyperscalers — secured competitive advantage for the next two years as AI becomes ambient intelligence everywhere.
