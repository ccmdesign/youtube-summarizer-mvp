title: NVIDIA's Rubin Changes AI Inference Forever (What You Need to Know)
description: >-
  NVIDIA just unveiled Rubin at CES 2026, a next-gen AI platform designed for
  inference at massive scale. In this video, we break down what Rubin actually
  is, how it compares to Blackwell, and what it means for developers building
  LLMs, AI agents, and real-time AI systems.


  Rubin isn’t just a faster GPU. It’s a rack-scale AI system built from six
  tightly connected chips, powered by NVLink 6, HBM4 memory, and massive
  GPU-to-GPU bandwidth.
