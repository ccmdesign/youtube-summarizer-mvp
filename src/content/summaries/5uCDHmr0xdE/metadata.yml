title: I Spent $289 So AI Could Build My Business
description: >-
  Today I’m joined by Samuel Thompson, an internet capitalist who’s launched 100
  companies in 10 years, and he walks me through a live, end-to-end build of an
  info product using AI. We break down how he goes from idea → AI-written book →
  mockups → Shopify product page → ad creatives in a ridiculously short amount
  of time. The big takeaway is that this isn’t just “info products,” it’s a
  repeatable launch system you can apply to e-comm, SaaS, mobile apps, and
  pretty much anything where customer acquisition matters. We also get into the
  real game: CAC vs LTV, conversion rates, and how to build what Sam calls a
  “rigged slot machine” you can scale.

  Key Points


  * Sam’s launch loop is offer → AI asset creation → Shopify page → Meta ads →
  iterate on math

  * Start with low-friction products (ebook/info) to validate customer
  acquisition fast

  * The real framework is CAC vs AOV vs conversion rate, not “brand vibes”

  * 3–5% conversion rate is a strong target on a direct-response product page

  * Use bonus gifts to increase perceived value and lift conversion

  * Static ads + strong angles can outperform everything when the message hits


  Numbered Section Summaries


  1. **The 1-Hour Launch Challenge**

  Sam opens by saying the goal is simple: by the end of the episode, you’ll know
  how to launch an info product using AI and sell it with Facebook ads—fast. I’m
  immediately locked in because he’s treating this like a live build, not
  theory.


  2. **Picking an Offer That Actually Works**

  We start with the first real question: *what are you selling?* Sam’s example
  is a divorce-related book based on a market insight—weddings are huge, and
  divorce is “half the size,” which still makes it massive. The important idea
  is picking something with obvious demand and low friction to ship.


  3. **Writing the Product with ChatGPT (MVP First, Then Upgrade)**

  Sam shows his exact process: a basic prompt creates an outline, then he
  generates chapters one-by-one. He starts with “good enough to sell,” then
  upgrades it later with deeper research, word/page constraints, and case study
  instructions to make it more robust.


  4. **Mockups + Visuals Without Being a Designer**

  To make the product feel real, he uses Envato Elements mockups so the book
  looks legit in ads and on the product page. The strategy is simple: don’t
  overcomplicate the early version—just make it sellable and presentable.


  5. **Why Shopify + Conversion Themes Matter**

  Sam explains that when you run paid traffic, most people land directly on the
  **product page**, not the homepage—so optimization goes there. He breaks down
  themes like Solo Drop and Elixir and how they’re built for conversion-first
  layouts.


  6. **The Math: CAC, AOV, Conversion Rate, and Price Testing**

  This is where it gets real: Sam talks through running a break-even funnel,
  trying to push AOV up, and keeping the economics clean. He also explains how
  raising price can increase ROAS if conversion rate doesn’t drop
  proportionally—because it’s all a math equation.


  7. **Copywriting Speed Runs with ChatGPT**

  We use ChatGPT to generate benefit bullets, product copy, bonuses, and even ad
  headlines on the spot. Sam’s style is super direct prompting because he wants
  an 80% head start, not a “final draft”—then he edits like a real marketer.


  8. **Ad Creatives: HeyGen + Canva + Winning Angles**

  Sam shows how he creates AI visuals (HeyGen), pulls scripts/headlines from
  ChatGPT, and rapidly builds static ads in Canva. He shares that one of his
  highest-performing angles is basically: “your lawyer won’t tell you
  this”—because trust is a huge lever in that market.
