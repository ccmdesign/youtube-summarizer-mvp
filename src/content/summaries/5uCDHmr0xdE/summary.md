  Today I’m joined by Samuel Thompson, an internet capitalist who’s launched 100 companies in 10 years, and he walks me through a live, end-to-end build of an info product using AI. We break down how he goes from idea → AI-written book → mockups → Shopify product page → ad creatives in a ridiculously short amount of time. The big takeaway is that this isn’t just “info products,” it’s a repeatable launch system you can apply to e-comm, SaaS, mobile apps, and pretty much anything where customer acquisition matters. We also get into the real game: CAC vs LTV, conversion rates, and how to build what Sam calls a “rigged slot machine” you can scale.

  Numbered Section Summaries
  
  1. **The 1-Hour Launch Challenge**
  Sam opens by saying the goal is simple: by the end of the episode, you’ll know how to launch an info product using AI and sell it with Facebook ads—fast. I’m immediately locked in because he’s treating this like a live build, not theory.
  
  2. **Picking an Offer That Actually Works**
  We start with the first real question: *what are you selling?* Sam’s example is a divorce-related book based on a market insight—weddings are huge, and divorce is “half the size,” which still makes it massive. The important idea is picking something with obvious demand and low friction to ship.
  
  3. **Writing the Product with ChatGPT (MVP First, Then Upgrade)**
  Sam shows his exact process: a basic prompt creates an outline, then he generates chapters one-by-one. He starts with “good enough to sell,” then upgrades it later with deeper research, word/page constraints, and case study instructions to make it more robust.
  
  4. **Mockups + Visuals Without Being a Designer**
  To make the product feel real, he uses Envato Elements mockups so the book looks legit in ads and on the product page. The strategy is simple: don’t overcomplicate the early version—just make it sellable and presentable.
  
  5. **Why Shopify + Conversion Themes Matter**
  Sam explains that when you run paid traffic, most people land directly on the **product page**, not the homepage—so optimization goes there. He breaks down themes like Solo Drop and Elixir and how they’re built for conversion-first layouts.
  
  6. **The Math: CAC, AOV, Conversion Rate, and Price Testing**
  This is where it gets real: Sam talks through running a break-even funnel, trying to push AOV up, and keeping the economics clean. He also explains how raising price can increase ROAS if conversion rate doesn’t drop proportionally—because it’s all a math equation.
  
  7. **Copywriting Speed Runs with ChatGPT**
  We use ChatGPT to generate benefit bullets, product copy, bonuses, and even ad headlines on the spot. Sam’s style is super direct prompting because he wants an 80% head start, not a “final draft”—then he edits like a real marketer.
  
  8. **Ad Creatives: HeyGen + Canva + Winning Angles**
  Sam shows how he creates AI visuals (HeyGen), pulls scripts/headlines from ChatGPT, and rapidly builds static ads in Canva. He shares that one of his highest-performing angles is basically: “your lawyer won’t tell you this”—because trust is a huge lever in that market.

## Key Takeaways

Samuel Thompson presents a high-velocity framework for launching businesses that treats every venture as a math equation of customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value.

* **Niche Identification:** Look for high-intent markets with established spending patterns, such as the massive "divorce market" as a counterpart to the wedding industry.

* **The AI Content Stack:** Use **ChatGPT** to draft entire books and sales copy, **Canva** for design templates, and **Envato Elements** for high-quality product mockups.

* **AOV Maximization:** Boost the **Average Order Value** by creating digital "starter kits" that include bonus checklists, templates, and guides generated via AI to increase perceived value.

* **Synthetic Marketing:** Utilize **Hey

Gen** for AI-generated video reviews and **11 Labs** for voice cloning to create high-converting video ads without high production costs.

* **The Math-First Strategy:** Focus on reaching a break-even point on the first sale to ensure a **negative cash conversion cycle**, allowing for infinite scaling through Meta Ads.

## Summary

### The Philosophy of the Serial AI Entrepreneur
Samuel Thompson, a seasoned entrepreneur who has launched 100 companies in a decade, introduces the concept of the **AI-powered solopreneur**. His approach is rooted in the "drop-shipping mentality," which prioritizes mathematical profitability and speed to market over long-term brand development. He views businesses as "rigged slot machines" where the goal is to put one dollar into advertising and reliably extract more than a dollar in return. This methodology relies on using AI to handle the heavy lifting of content creation, design, and marketing, allowing a single individual to operate with the efficiency of a full team.

### Building the Info Product with ChatGPT
Thompson walks through the creation of an info product titled "The Divorce Bible." He explains that the idea originated from observing the massive wedding industry and realizing that with 50% of marriages ending in divorce, the market for divorce assistance is equally significant but less saturated by info products. Using **ChatGPT**, he generates a comprehensive book structure, including chapters on legal strategies and child protection. 

By prompting the AI to expand on specific sections and include case studies, he transforms a 70-page draft into a 197-page robust guide. The formatting is handled in **Google Docs** (set to 5x7 dimensions) and exported as a PDF. To finalize the physical look, he uses **Canva** for the cover design and **Envato Elements** for professional mockups, giving the digital product the visual weight of a physical book.

### Engineering a High-Conversion Shopify Store
Transitions from traditional landing pages to **Shopify** are crucial for improving attribution and **Average Order Value (AOV)**. Thompson utilizes conversion-optimized themes like **Solo Drop** or **Elixir**, which are specifically designed for single-product stores. These themes include built-in features like multi-tier discounts, countdown timers, and mobile-optimized layouts. 

To increase the transaction value, he transforms a single ebook into a "Starter Kit" by bundling it with AI-generated digital bonuses such as a "Divorce Evidence Checklist" or a "Custody Preparation Template." This strategy addresses different buyer pain points simultaneously, making the $58–$79 price point more palatable to customers and helping the entrepreneur cover the **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** immediately.

### Advanced AI Marketing and Video Ad Creation
The bottleneck for most businesses is creative production, which Thompson solves using **Hey

Gen**. By selecting AI avatars and using **11 Labs** for voice cloning, he creates "customer review" videos that feel authentic. He notes that using a cloned version of his own voice provides the natural inflection that standard AI voices often lack. These videos are paired with static ads created in Canva using templates. One of his most successful hooks involves the "things your lawyer won't tell you" angle, which taps into the inherent distrust consumers often have for expensive legal services. He recommends testing these creatives with a daily budget of approximately $50 to $100 on Meta platforms to find a winning "rigged" ad set.

### White-Labeling and Physical Product Expansion
While info products offer the highest margins, Thompson also discusses the viability of white-labeling physical goods. He highlights tools like **Suppliful** for supplements and **Anox** for skincare, which allow entrepreneurs to drop-ship custom-branded physical products. This allows for rapid testing of market demand before committing to large manufacturing runs. Whether selling sugar water as "Hummingbird Nectar" or selling skincare, the core strategy remains the same: use AI to generate the branding and marketing materials, then use paid traffic to validate the offer's profitability.

## Context

Greg Isenberg, a prominent figure in the tech community known for his expertise in building multi-million dollar communities and SAS businesses, hosts Samuel Thompson to bridge the gap between software-centric entrepreneurship and high-velocity e-commerce/info-product sales. This discussion is particularly relevant in the current economic climate where the "solopreneur" trend is accelerating due to the accessibility of generative AI tools. Thompson's background—having launched 100 companies—provides a unique, high-volume perspective on market validation. This video is a masterclass for individuals looking to escape the "time-for-money" trap by building automated cash-flow systems. It is highly beneficial for digital marketers, side-hustlers, and software developers who want to apply high-conversion marketing tactics to their technical products.
