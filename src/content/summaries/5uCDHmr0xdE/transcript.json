  "fullText": "If you're a soloreneur or you want to be a soloreneur, if the idea of having a business 100% run by AI interests you, this is the episode for you. I brought on my friend Samuel. And Samuel is really interesting cuz he's launched 100 companies in 10 years. But what's even more interesting is a lot of those companies are completely powered by AI. Now, you know me, I'm more of a software guy, mobile app, SAS, that sort of thing. He's an e-commerce and info guy, but I think we can learn a lot from people like that. And in this episode, that's what he does. He teaches me how to use Shopify, how to use chat GPT, how to use Hey Genen, and how to use all these things within the context of building an info product or building an e-commerce product. It got my creative juices flowing. So, if it got mine, it probably will yours. Now, if you made it this far, would appreciate a like, a comment, and subscribe because it lets me know I should be creating content like this in the future, and it gets you more highquality content in your feed. So, win-win. Enjoy the episode and become a soloreneur. Today, >> we got Samuel Thompson on the pod. This guy has launched a 100 companies in 10 years. He's a capitalist on the internet. The guy's playing with AI all day long. And today he's promised to share a lot of sauce. Samuel, by the end of this episode, what are people going to get out of it? >> You will know how to uh launch an info product using Foley AI and start making money uh selling that product via Facebook ads in an hour >> in an hour. In an hour or less. And the tools that we're using, like just just name them off, like what are all the tools? >> Yeah, super super quick. We're going to use uh chat GBT out the box. We're going to use Shopify. Uh we're going to use Canva. Uh we're going to hire somebody on Fiverr. Uh and then Invato Elements to give us some mockups for uh for our images. >> Okay. Awesome. And I just want to give one caveat to the listener, which is that even if you don't want to launch an info product, this is going to help you launch an e-commerce business, a SAS business, a mobile app business. Am I wrong on that? >> Oh, 100%. >> All right. Well, let's get into it. >> Dope. Dope. Um, I mean, the first the first thing that I always think about is like what are you going to sell, right? And so, a lot of that is it comes down to offer. Um the one that we'll talk about today is is this you know divorce book uh that really came from uh me getting married in a couple of months and you know the the wedding industry is humongous right like everyone's selling you know on Etsy you have planners and cards and like literally everything you can need on on the wedding side and it's super expensive and as we were going through the process of planning our wedding you know I was looking at the stats and it's like well 50% of uh marriages end in divorce. And I was like, well, if if the wedding market is huge, you know, the divorce market probably is like half the size. And so that's probably a massive market. Um which those people are being advertised to a bunch of different ways, uh primarily by, you know, family law or divorce attorneys. And that's a service that's associated with this offer of like when you're divorced, all of that. Uh but there's other things that you can offer, you know, info products or physical products or any of these other vehicles that you can run with. And I'm a big fan of like super low friction. And so an ebook became kind of the natural like, well, what if I just sold a book that helped people with this specific thing? It started super simple as like a really messy chat GBT generated book uh onto a prospective landing page that I made in an hour while watching the Laker game. Got a couple of sales early. It then graduated to like, oh, I should probably, you know, try to make a little bit more money or put a little bit more effort into it, which is what this page that you're looking at right now, which I built in ClickFunnels, um, is actually for. And so what I was trying to do is convert higher and get a higher AOV, right? And create a bunch of content for this. Um, conversion rate went up, which is awesome. Um, but Clickfunnels long-term is not really where I want to live with this product. And so I want to do Shopify. And if anyone's seen me on Ker stuff, they've seen me do some of the stuff with the hummingbirds and and all of those. Uh, and so Shopify is like my preferred go-to platform. And so I figured while we're hanging out, we might as well just build it live and do the entire Shopify build from zero, uh, what themes we use, all the tools, how we write all the copy, how we do all of that, how I think about the conversion side, um, and see where it takes us. Tracks. >> Let's do it. Yeah. I mean, I find it just honestly hilarious that you're about to get married and you created uh, your insight was around on divorce. You know, it works. Like I said to you before, like when when you know 300 copies of the book showed up in my front door, my fiance was uh jokingly concerned. She was like, \"What are you what is what is going on here?\" And I was like, \"Baby, it's it's for ecom. Come on, get with it.\" >> Yeah. >> Um and so, yeah, I think I think just transitioning this like super quick, uh what I can do is just show how I actually wrote the book. Um, so this was pretty uh simple from the start. Um, all I popped in on chat GPT was I want to write a book called The Divorce Bible: How to Win Your Divorce that helps individuals navigate their divorce and helps them win. Sick. Like literally a 30 secondond prompt. Um, then it worked through like the structure, right? Part one, part two, all the chapters uh all the way through. And then all I do is go like, \"All right, please write chapter 2, right?\" And then it writes chapter 2, you know, do the next chapter all the way through to give you like a super bare bones uh book, right? I think this book, this first version of it was, you know, maybe 70 pages, just enough to give me something to sell. Um, and then once I had a little bit more uh like sales actually coming through the door, I went through and did a deep research report on it and then gave it a little bit more direction around what those chapters should be um based on that report and made it much more robust. I mean this book for being AI generated is actually really good and and it lands at 197 printed pages um and is really in-depth with case studies and examples um which basically was just me changing the prompt from like please write chapter 10 uh to write chapter 10 but make sure it's x number of pages or x number of words to this number of words uh you know make sure to include a case study right like that sort of vibe then all I did was take copy and paste all of these into a Google doc uh and then formatted it as a 5x7 which is this size um and then exported it as a PDF. Uh and then all I did was design the book cover. I just used the Canva template here. Um this is literally like one of their out of the box templates and I just changed the copy on it um to be when you're divorced. Then you take this as a PDF. You do uh uh what's called a PDF merge. There's a thousand free tools on the internet for that. And you just put uh PDF one, then the PDF of the book, and then a PDF of the back cover, which is this. Um and it puts it all together into one PDF file. That is your book start to finish. Um as you can see, there's there's more books coming, dude. We're gonna we're gonna try to get LTV up on this. Um but yeah, so you do that, then all of a sudden you you have a book. Um, and then it's really easy. Like you start looking into how you need these mockups and and stuff that for content, which you'll see as we start to build out the Shopify store. Um, pretty simple. It's it's literally just Inato. Um, and so Invato Elements, it's like, I don't know, 15 bucks a month. Um, you just go grab templates. >> I don't think I've ever used this. >> It's fire. I literally use it three times a week. Um because all you do is so like has all these product mockups for books, right? Or literally whatever you want. Like you could do, you know, a car wrap like for a truck. Um any like that. You download these, you pop it into Photoshop, you upload uh your cover here. Uh and then it literally just like places it on the book, which is sweet. Um which then gives you your product photos. um or just like any stuff. You can also we'll do it on chat GPT to like how to generate some of these as I as I need more content as we get through. Um but you know up until this point it's it's been like uh how do we do minimum viable product on this? Does it work? How do we get it to work? Um and how do you get like at the end of the day at the end of the day it's all like a math equation, right? And so like CAC versus LTV and really like you want your cash conversion cycle to be negative. So you're like, \"All right, how do I spend $20 to sell this book for 27 and it cost me $7 to ship so that it's at break even at a minimum?\" Um, I was able to get to roughly break even on this. Uh, but I struggled to push AOV up and like that's where I want to go into Shopify. multiple product list things, a little bit more of like an offer creation to try to drive it up uh and better attribution from uh Meta uh as I run those ads. And so that'll be the main switch. Um which we can just get started on. Uh Shopify is awesome. There are two there's a there's a bunch of themes that exist um that can make your life a lot easier. One that I talk about a lot is uh called Solo Drop. Um this is specifically designed for single product stores. Uh it's conversion optimize. You can literally just buy it and it has a bunch of these plugins already built in. Um this is actually what Hummingbird is built on. Um which is this one. And so this is a solo drop theme. Super basic. Um but like conversion optimized, right? where it's like you can put these scene pieces on. >> You built this, right? This is your company. >> Yeah. All through Solo Drop. >> Um, >> and so, right, like you get multi-tier discounts, like a bunch of that stuff that you would need to be able to convert. And so, it's pretty easy to just pop in and start filling in copy and imagery. Um, I'm not necessarily proud of this page. Um, but as an example, I also built this, which is the theme that we're going to use for this is also an AI product, by the way. Um, which is a fun one. We're going to use this theme, um, to build out the divorce one, right? And so, you can see kind of the callouts that it has here. Selling fast, right? Like a bunch of this stuff that you would want to boost your conversion rate are built into a few of these themes. This one's called Elixir. This is what we're going to use for divorce. Um yeah, like this was also similarly fully an AI product uh that I just was testing. Um all of this stuff is is AI generated. If you're looking for products to sell, uh Supplel is an awesome starting place. Um they are white label like supplements and like personal grooming products. Uh and so you can look through all of these. They let you put your own brand. It's basically drop shipping supplements. Um, and so huge fan of that because you can just use that to get your product squared up. Obviously, your margin is going to be a little bit worse when you do it this way. Welcome to drop shipping. Um, but to test something and like validate that it works before going and trying to fill anQ at, you know, a legit manufacturer like a merit manufacturing or or someone similar, this gets you in the door to like test products faster. A Nox is another great one. um they're more skincare and so like you know face moisturizers and and a bunch of that stuff like we've all seen ads for products like these um and I don't want to say that all of them are are using stuff like this but I know a bunch of bigger brands now that like started testing offers using this as their fulfillment backend um and so same system that we'll do on the happies and then this one on the hummingbirds this is just sugar so that everyone everyone knows like it's just sugar. It's just sugar. There's a guy on Amazon that's done $30 million selling sugar as hummingbird nectar on uh over the last 10 years and his branding is like atrocious. Has never ran a Facebook ad in his life. And I was like, dude, if he can sell $30 million of it's literally sugar. That's what hummingbirds eat, sugar water. Um I could probably try to sell some of this direct consumer. And so, um, I'll probably end up going, funny enough, I'll probably end up going to a baking mix manufacturer for this one because they have sugar and just be like, I just need sugar. That's it. And so, I think that's hopefully the plan. We'll see. Um, we're going to launch this one again probably like end of March, early April as it gets into spring, just cuz that's when the hummingbirds start to migrate north. You can read about it all in my uh, hummingbird 101 uh, book that was also AI generated. That's an upsell. um when you when you buy hummingbird food. Um and so uh that'll be its own. But back to solo drop. Great tool. Not super expensive either. I think lifetime's like 200. Yeah, that's dope. Um elixir is the one that I've been using more. Um I don't remember their pricing. 175 for one license. I'm sure I could add more, but just for the sake of the game, let's do it from scratch. Um, so you basically go on here and then they have these templates that you see. Uh, you can see that that the the one looks probably pretty familiar. Uh, is this this supplement one? That's my happies. >> There he is. >> Um, and so it's like literally just a clone of that just to test it. Um, I like that one. So, I'm just going to go with that because I already know it and we can move faster on this. Um, beauty template access supplements. Oh, the Discord group is kind of cool. Um, >> I got to say, Sam, like I'm not I don't know if you know this about me, but like I'm a software guy, mobile apps, >> SAS, that sort of thing. So, like >> yeah, >> this whole world that you're sharing like I had no idea existed. Like >> dude, it's nuts. It's like uh I mean it's all like it it's rooted in drop shipping, right? Like during COVID, that's like where I really cut my teeth. I was like I sold like $800,000 of a teeth whitening product that I found on on AliExpress. Um and what it did, it's interesting cuz similar to you, like I spend way more of my time, like personal time really in in like agency world and and software. Um, but my approach to marketing is all in drop shipping where it's it's like so routed in in the math, right? Like cuz when you're a drop shipper, when you're 19 and you have $1,000, like you have to find a product in a marketing angle that like makes your math work super well. Um, and so it's literally all been it's it's like drop shipping mentality applied to those other things. Like for our agencies, like we run Facebook ads, that's it. And so it's like I just run it because I I do it like drop shipping. Like it's it's ecom import theme. Upload a zip file. When you buy the elixir, they will send you a zip file. Um beauty. That's not the one that I bought, but [ __ ] it. We'll just see where it goes. And so that goes in there. 30 minutes in. Dude, we're going to do this. Watch. I have faith. >> Oh yeah. >> Yeah. I'm I'm like invested in this now. Like I need I need to know how to do this myself. I got you. Yeah, we'll wait for that to load. Um, yeah. I mean, a lot of a lot of this theme makes it so you're just in like content creation mode, right? Like you're just trying to load up all of the different elements of it that allow for it to start to work. Um, luckily I have a bunch of that already and so like we don't have to go from from zero zero, but we'll be able to do it. I'm going to need another fresco dude. License required. Good thing I have one. Pop that in there. Boom. Okay, we've got the foundation. Um, I always start when I'm doing this, uh, you're running when you're running ads at, uh, a product direct to consumer on Shopify, uh, 90% of the time you're running that directly to the product page, um, of which we need, uh, a product. So, I need to do that. Um, and so I don't really mess around with the homepage that much. It's mostly just like some filler content because no one's really going to see it. Um, and so this is when your divorce. One thing I'm going to do on this one is call it the starter kit because I want to push AOV up, right? If it's just the book, it's hard to sell a book for 70 bucks. like it's just not really it's just not really going to be a thing. Uh description doesn't really matter. Let me see if I can find a easy copy of this. >> By the way, if you know for people who are thinking about like what is the price, what should my price point be? >> You can just ask ChateBT if your price point makes sense, right? So if you're like, hey, when you're divorced, I'm trying to sell it for $79. is like chatbt is probably going to tell you it's a bad idea if you just say like my buyer is going to you have to like explain who your buyer is in your avatar in like somewhat in pretty good detail like average >> what they're going to be you know their average salary that sort of thing >> yes agreed wholeheartedly >> look at our little guy dude totally AI generated >> just the way you like it >> just the way I like it dude I'm always down for a little AIness this. Okay, cool. So, now we've got our product in here. We're going to list this product at So, when I was running the ads, I was selling the book for 29 bucks. Um, and I was I had a one-click upsell on the back. So, like if you go through this funnel, um, right? Like you put in all of your information, you hit next, and there's a there's a bump offer. I'm not going to click it cuz it's going to autofill my personal information. Uh, and so I won't. But there's a button that lets you like add a $17 or $18 product onto it. And so it pushes your AOV from 29. If they if they if they buy it, it's it's 48. Mine was landing on average at like 42 43. And my CAC was roughly like on good days it was sub 40. On bad days it was like 45. And so it all kind of settled into like a break even funnel. Um, but I know I can acquire customers sub 45. And so like when I think about pricing here, it's like, all right, how do I get this to like, you know, 58 and then compare that price at, you know, 90 99 bucks for the starter kit. Um, and then we'll save that product. Pop back to the theme that we're going to build. Edit theme. Let's see if it gives me my product. Yellow. Look at that, dude. We've got ourselves a product. Uh 99% of traffic is mobile, so I'm only thinking about uh mobile optimization. Um then you're just really filling in all of the content here, right? Um, and so obviously this this template is built around uh some sort of beauty product to some degree. Um, and so dude, for the sake for the sake of the game, dude. >> Mhm. >> Password disabled. For the sake of the game, just just for your the audience, I have never done this before, but like is we're gonna take this, we're gonna pop into chat GPT. I'm gonna send this link. I'm going to say look at this website and give me all the copy based on the content of the book and the fact that the book helps people going through divorce win. Focus on major value props, dude. Let's see if this works, dog. This would be pretty nifty. I guess I could give it my other one, too. The one that already has a bunch of the copy because that was that was going to be more of my um stuff. Oh, proven strategies to protect your kids. Yep. Yep. Yep. When I'm running these, I'm It's like all It's mostly It's mostly copyrightiting, >> which is sick because chatbt helps with that. Um I mean, [ __ ] we'll just V1 it. Let's just do what it did, right? >> Yeah. And obviously, like if we were doing this for real Z's, we wouldn't just take like the first output of it. >> Oh, no. Yeah, you're reworking it. I mean, I I have a bunch of like that reworked copy on this page. Um, >> right. So, like I basically asked it for a bunch of ideas and headlines and then just went through and started grabbing bits and pieces about it. Um, but yeah, I mean most of this stuff like I I didn't like come up with the I don't I've never been I've never been married, you know what I mean? Like I can't talk about divorce like that. Um, but luckily luckily other people have talked about it on the internet and ChachiB knows how to find it. Um, and so I think that that's the move. Um, one piece that I like is this little uh emojis benefit list. This is fire. Um, and so this is like what are the five main benefits of this product. Uh, write them each in 40 characters or less. Oh, love it, dude. Just so on the nose. You got to protect your kids, dude. You got to protect your kids. >> You know, we can't be messing around. >> Boom. Protect your kids. Oh, I could do more than 50 characters. Let's do do it again, but max 75. >> And you're doing it longer just cuz uh because it fits, right? So like to me that just feels like wasted conversion space. Um but I don't want it too long to go to two lines and it starts to eat up screen real estate on the page. Um and so that's my general approach. So, >> and from meta ads, >> what sort of conversion rate is good on a page like this? >> Um, yeah, I love that question. Um, I would say if you're sitting between like three and five on something like this, you're in like a reasonably good space. Um, there's so many variables with it. most of it uh is a function of like price and like type of uh product. So like you can imagine like if you've gone and shopped for clothes on you know I don't know jcrew.com like you might add a bunch of stuff to cart but you might not buy and so like their their percentages are different than on something that's like a direct like please purchase this right now. Um, but 3 to five is what I was hitting on hummingbirds at a little bit of a cheaper price point. Uh, but a little bit less value. Um, and so that would be really where I would target for this. >> Cool. Yeah. I guess if you're under three, you probably need to rework your copy, your offer. If you're over five, you just want to pile as much traffic as possible to this page. >> Yeah. And and if you're over five, uh depending on how your your math is looking, you might you might consider raising your price. Um right, because again, it's all math. It's like is it's it's cost of traffic times conversion rate times AOV, right? And so it's like if you can go and bump your price by more than 20% and your conversion rate only takes a 10% hit, like not Yeah, like 10% of the five, right? So it goes to 4.5, but you push your price up. Mathematically, your rorowaz goes up, right? Cuz like your cost of traffic maintains equal. You just pull more cash out of the back. Um, and so you're testing that, which is like why I always do this compare at price. Like I'll do price testing, right? I'll run $1,000 worth of ads at this thing at 58, see where my metrics lie, and then I'll be like, \"Okay, this right now has this holiday sale.\" and it's like we're going to call this the New Year sale and it's like all right we're going to go do a I don't know a St. Patrick's Day sale and it's going to be a lower amount. What is the impact of conversion rate versus AOV and and on rorowass? Cuz like all this is like all I'm ever trying to do on ecom is I'm not necessarily trying to go build some massive brand. I'm just trying to create like what I would call like a rigged slot machine where I know I can put a dollar in and get a $1.30 30 cents out and then it's like how do how do I put as many dollars into that thing as humanly possible while that math holds and then when that math it's why I've done a 100 company like when that math stops holding I just go and do another thing that gives me that degree of return. Um, and so that's why I like info on on this sort of stuff is like you could just shut this thing down to get like tomorrow and launch another ebook at the next day if you think that it has a better chance at running that math. And so it's not as much of an LTV game here. I think it makes sense to like play into it. And I like talking about it cuz like if if someone had like 24 hours in the day and they were like going to make this their business, they would treat it a little bit differently than I do. And they'd go deeper and they'd definitely launch more books and they would try to push LTV up and they'd launch a community on the back for, you know, divorced parents and like grab 199 bucks a year for a Facebook group of like, yeah, like these are all the people that have gone through what you've gone through. Like there's so many things that you can do on the back of like validating your own ability to generate customers around a specific offer, right? And so it's like I always just start with this stuff cuz it's easier um to literally just like validate that part cuz if that's all that's all that's all entrepreneurs are trying to do at the beginning of launching anything is like can I profitably acquire customers or like can I acquire customers at all? Cuz if you can't then what are you doing? And then you just move on to the next product. Um, okay. So that's all there. 2025 verified results. Latest and most upto-date product based on modern science. That's hilarious. Based on customer reviews. I already know. I already know cuz it happens all the time. Yes, I'm going to put fake reviews on here to start and then I will replace them as I get real ones. I promise. That's always the game. But you got to just see what it's going to look like. Limited time free gift offer. This is sick. This is a great opportunity to use AI. Um, create a list of five free bonus gifts they receive when they buy the book. These should all be digital products or downloads. >> And could you explain why bonus gifts as a strategy is important? >> Yeah, it's just perceived value. Um, it just boosts conversion rate, right? So, like you could you could uh sell the book at at 29 bucks and and have a standalone like funnel for that or you can throw in other stuff that makes them feel like they're getting a better and better deal. Um, the way that I try to think about it on these is giving enough variety here where somebody will see one of them and be like, \"Oh, shoot. I really need that.\" Right? Like whatever this one is. Let's see. Free custom. Where's brush? Um, right. Like divorce evidence checklist. Somebody might see that and be like, \"Oh, I actually need that.\" And then it's like part of this bigger purchase, right? And so just it's a conversion rate thing more than than anything, right? Custody preparation. Like somebody's going to see that that knows that they're going to be going through custody situation and they're like, \"Oh yeah, like I need that.\" And then we're going to go to one line custody preparation template. Um it's just value ad like what what can you do to give the customer more more of what they um need and like drive their desire to buy this thing up. Um all these icons I would do the exact same thing um of like Canva here. So like what is that first one? financial financial protection quick guide. Actually, dude, I was over here designing some things. So, like financial protect all that it is is a screen. This is a this is actually just a Canva template. Um, and so whatever we want to call any of these like we can toss in. And you can just do these ones in Canva uh to make all of this stuff. And so it's like cool, they get all this stuff for free, they purchase it. This is all like conversion rate stuff um that people are looking for like you do all that description. So then you could go here write a three sentence product description. Do you do you prompt the way that I prompt or are you like firing away like some some pretty robust >> prompts? Yeah. I feel like the way you prompt is like very to the point, rudimentary, like you're not there's no fat, you know? >> No, it's just I just need this, dude. >> I need this. I'm I'm more of like a I I'll rarely prompt something that's one sentence. >> Interesting. So, you know, and I don't know, you know, sometimes maybe you get better if you're if you're more direct and you're just like one sentence, but I also think that giving that extra context is helpful. >> Oh, for sure. For sure. I think there's like uh part of this is like we're under a shot clock and so it's moving quick. Exactly. But I would say I' like generally that that's my style of like cuz I I am very rarely trying to get a final output out of AI. I need like I I want like a 80% head start, right? So it's like I'll grab these and be like, \"All right, like that's cool.\" And then I'll edit this stuff a little bit more. Part of that is like I've also been running ads and like writing copy for a very long time and so sometimes it's just faster for me to just like what give me the idea and then I can write around it and so that's a little bit of a different approach to that. Yeah. So this I mean this process like we can keep going through it. I think people probably get the vibe right like you are filling in all of this copy with stuff from chat. you just ask chatbt for specific stuff. Um, this stuff, this is all uh, hey genen and so if you want good photos and videos of people um, like holding the product, I generally do it through hen. Um, which is pretty fun. Uh, there's definitely nuances with Hey Genen. One thing that I found with Hunen that's really good is their uh you like it's with 11 Labs too but like the voice cloning feature is like I think the problem with AI video is like they don't always get the fluctuation or like what's that called with your voice like the it's like fluctuation >> I think. >> Yeah. Right. They like they don't they don't capture like how someone would actually say it. Um, and so a big piece of it, uh, for me has been going and creating the video, but doing it with a voice that I cloned of myself saying the script. Um, which is a pretty pretty fun one. I make a bunch of these, dude. All the test different stuff. Um, so these when you make like the avatar 4, I basically just like pick one of their That's hilarious. Stephen's going to see that and laugh. Um, I pick one of their avatars and then you can put in the product photo and then it generates like a bunch of images of the person before you turn them into like a talking video and then I just screenshot that and roll them into like you can see it on on all of these, right? Like that's that guy and that's just a screenshot of a preview that they give me before they generate the full video. Um, and then you can do this with chat GBT too is like you just say write a write a 45second script uh for an ad that is a customer reviewing the book. And then you'll just pop you'll edit it, but like then you'll just pop that into your Hey, Jen. and it'll generate. I don't know if you'll be able to hear this, but see how it's like just it's a little funky, but when you do the voice clone thing, it works a lot better. But then you can go and like create a bunch of those ads. And so you have all these images and then you just start building out the ad creatives in Canva. You take those images, you're you're grabbing all these headline copies uh directly from here. That's his All right. Uh cool. Thanks. Now, write 15 high converting static ad creative headlines. Um, so then you take all those, you'll you'll toss them into these are literally, dude, like they're all just templates directly out of Canva. Like you're just loading in images, it's all like what is the headline? Uh, and that's like when you're testing it, right? Like this is the same. This is an ad creative, right? It's like a picture that I took of the book. Um, and then I just had it write the copy, right? Like this one works so well, dude. People do not trust their divorce attorneys at all. They're always my highest performing ads, dude. It's crazy. Um, it's like no stuff that your lawyer won't tell you. And it's like >> that's the people, right, that are buying. Um, but yeah, like all these are just like images that I took. All this stuff is the same. All AI generated with a little bit of love. Um, and then these headlines, right? Like it'll just pump out headlines like this, right? Most people lose their divorce before court. Great headline. The book your lawyer won't hand you, right? Like all of this sort of stuff that that can get used in in copy across the board, right? So like when you scroll through here, right? Like this is just what they gave me. Like divorce is war. Win yours, right? It's all just the copy that um I'm pulling out of chat GPT. And so again, once you once you go through and have this whole all the content filled out, right? Like using the Hey Gen stuff, using the chat GPT stuff. Um I mean you could even some of these images are are generated directly with chat GPT, right? generate an image of this sort of person holding this sort of or the screenshot of the product um to get a bunch of those and then you just doctor them up in Canva and then you publish this on whatever your domain's going to be and you go and run the ads um and the ads are like I said kind of like primarily statics like you just find like templates like you can these are the recently used ones that I have like this is literally the template right here it's like I didn't come up with anything I just grabbed whatever the available templates um to get those ads live and then toss all of them in in a CBO campaign on Facebook tested at you know I generally like minimum 50 bucks a day but like if your product is more than 50 bucks a day I would just whatever your product is priced at if you know you can get one purchase off of that ad spend to break even it's like where I would start. Um, and so for this, if I push it at 60 bucks, I I would probably run it at 100 bucks a day just for the love of the game. Um, but like you can start with with like 50 bucks a day pretty easily. And so I don't know what else is worth like going deep like they'll literally if we keep going it'll just be like copy pasting all of this >> over time, you You basically, dude, you've basically shown how one person could use AI to, you know, build a business that looks, feels, smells, tastes like a really, really big business and, you know, hopefully impact people. You know, hopefully >> hopefully this win your divorce book, like when I, you know, looking at some of the the content like it seems valuable to me as a man who's never even contemplated divorce and half married, but you know what I mean, right? >> Yeah. >> Um, so what's really cool is I think this this shows some of the opportunity that, you know, how many thousands of different niches and thousands of products >> exist. That's crazy. And it's not, you know, it's it's one of those I I try to tell people like the hummingbird stuff like uh there there's no part of me that's ever trying to convince somebody that this is going to be like the next billion dollar idea, but like I I I have like very tangible proof that things like this can make you $100,000 in profit a year, right? And it's like >> it's it's a like me running hummingbirds at this point other than the fact that I was manufacturing it myself. Like it really takes me about 90 minutes a week to like make some new ads, look at the ads that are working, make a couple adjustments and then like the ads do all the heavy lifting, right? Like instead of me having to sit there and be like, \"Dude, I got to produce, you know, six YouTube videos a month in effort, I can also just probably go spend money on ads to like create that rigged ATM.\" Um, and for me, it's like I just want I want the ads to do the heavy lifting. Um, and so it turns into I mean I have a handful of these. I've, you know, shown you three already. um and have another one that I'm going to launch, you know, whenever I can find 2 hours. Um and so it's a very Yeah, it's just it's simple. It's like find an offer that makes sense and try to make your math work. >> Sam, thanks for for coming on. I really enjoyed this. Um I'm feeling a bit inspired. I'm actually it's reaffirmed my belief that understanding how good info people do things and some of the tools that they use could be applied to mobile apps and SAS. So, >> I'm about to get to work. You got my brain spinning. >> Let's go. >> Um, and uh you'll have to come back on hopefully. >> Uh, once I get it live, we can do a we'll do a a Facebook ads version where I go deeper on that half of it. Um, >> and so that's easy. >> That sounds good. Yeah. comment uh on YouTube what you want to learn from from Samuel uh in the part two of this Facebook ads, you know, you name it. And uh until next time, I'll include the links where you can go and play with a lot of these tools, templates, where you can follow Samuel on the internet. And uh I encourage you to have some fun and go build some cool things. >> Easy money. Take care, dude.",
