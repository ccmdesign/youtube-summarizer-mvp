  In this video, I reveal the AI design tools that genuinely transformed my
  workflow—from planning and asset generation to animation and design
  conversion.

  First up is Design OS, an open-source planning tool that works seamlessly with
  claude code, Cursor, and Copilot. Whether you're exploring claude code vs
  cursor or cursor vs claude code debates, Design OS bridges the gap with its
  structured approach. Learn how to use claude code alongside these claude code
  skills to turn messy ideas into technical blueprints.

  I also cover Vizcom and Mixboard for asset generation, GoFullPage for
  competitor analysis, and how Claude extracts UI details using prompt
  engineering techniques. From there, claude code best practices come into play
  as it generates entire websites from your specifications.

  For animation, Magic Animator and LottieFiles add motion to your designs.
  Plus, the HTML2Design plugin with MCP integration connects your ai coding
  agents directly to Figma—perfect for those interested in claude code agents
  and claude code subagents workflows.

  Whether you're using claude code desktop, claude code vscode, or looking for
  claude code free options, this crash course in artificial intelligence and
  coding covers it all. No chatgpt or openai required—just pure claude power for
  your next project.
