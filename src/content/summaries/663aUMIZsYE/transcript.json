  "fullText": "So clothe code has become very popular lately over the holidays. I saw a lot of more people talking about it even though I have been using this since launch. So what I did today is I just gathered like a bunch of questions that I have seen in my comment sections and I kind of put it into like a claw code Q&A and you can see yeah so uh we have five questions I thought we could answer and for this I have used kind of my new my new video agents that I'm playing around with trying to learn more about. So this is for my NPC creative uh company that I'm going to launch soon. So yeah, let's just get into it and answer some questions about cloud code. Hello Chris, hope you are doing well. So I have a question about running cloud code in parallel. I see all these videos on people talking about oh I run cloud code in parallel. Uh but how can I do that and is there any benefits and can you just show me like a quick example of doing this so I can try it out? Uh thanks for the videos and have a great day. Okay, so that's a pretty cool question. So I think I can show you pretty easy how this can be done. So here we are in cursor and of course I can load up cloud code in my terminal but this time we're going to open up two terminals right that is in the same directory and let's just launch claude here. We can go to this terminal and launch cloud. You can see we have no files in this directory now. So what we can do just to be efficient that is one thing you can do when running things in parallel. you can do more work in one uh codebase at the same time, right? Uh but of course, you got to be a bit careful here. So, let's say we did create a simple snake game in JavaScript in this terminal and here we're going to do it in create a simple snake game in Python code. So, I can run this in one terminal. I can go to this in the other terminal. And even though this is in the same directory, cloud code can work in parallel, right? And you can see here in the snake game, we're going to write the game in Python. And here we're going to do it in probably with JavaScript and HTML. Okay, so let's see gives us some time, right? Instead of uh doing this in one window in two operations, we do it in parallel and that kind of half our time. So let's see if they work here. So let's run the snake game. Let's open up the HTML. Uh, okay. So yeah, this works. Uh, not the best one, but yeah, it works. Okay, that's good. Let's check out this one. So, let's exit, paste, and yeah. Okay, this was more text base uh in the terminal, but it works. So, yeah, that's one thing you can do. You can run this in parallel, right? And the one thing that is a bit of an issue is it would be great if you had some kind of file reservation system. So this agent in this window is working on this file. So the other agent can't do that now. Uh but that may be with something we can talk about in the future. Reserving files for edit for one specific agent that is running in parallel. But yeah, I hope that answers your question. >> Hi Chris. Uh my question for the Q&A is uh I use a lot of things on my computer, right? I do a lot of stuff, but basically I don't do a lot of coding, but what else can I do using cloud code? I really wanted to try it out. Could you just show me an example of some non-coding task I can do on cloud code? Thank you. >> Yeah, sure. Uh that's a good question. So, uh my example of this is usually uh I just like to do like some show you how you can use cloud code for video editing. I think that's one cool thing. So, it's not I guess it's somewhat coding related. Uh but we use some kind of library ffmpeg, but you don't really need any coding skills. But there's a bunch of other stuff you can do too, like manage your calendar and email and stuff like that. Uh, but I've done other videos on that. So, uh, I want to play a short bit of this clip here, and I'm going to show you how we can use Cloud Code to actually edit this video. [music] [music] Okay, so that was pretty cool. So let's say we wanted to use cloud code to just uh we don't need the full clip, right? We just need the first 10 seconds and the last 5 seconds. So if I go into claw now, uh you can see we have the the file here. So I can just type in a prompt something like so we can just do something like in the video and I'm going to tag the video here. Please use ffmpeg to edit to get the first 5 seconds and the last 5 seconds. merge it and save it as anime guitar.mpp4. So you can see now we are running cloud code. I have of course ffmpeg installed previously. So we're going to probe it first, right? And claude knows every command from ffmpeg and you can see the 38.7 seconds. Okay, so it knows how to cut it and we got the two clips. Now we're going to merge them and that should be it, right? And we can check out how this turned out. And you can see how fast it is editing videos. And now it's going to probe to check. And this looks 10 seconds. Yeah, that's perfect. So, let's play it and see if it worked. [music] [music] So, yeah, that worked right. It was a bit strange because of the cut there. But uh you can see we can use cloud code for other things than just coding related task. Even though this is coding related but you can do other things like I said connect your email calendar, manage your notes and it doesn't really have to be exactly coding related and that is so versatile about agents like this and it's super fun to use it for other things too and very efficient. So hopefully that answers your question. So yeah, let's take a look at question three. Uh but before we do that, uh I have a small message I wanted to share. So yeah, here it is. A couple of months back, we did a video on this channel on the Nvidia GGX Spark Machine. Pretty cool local so supercomput you can just run from home, right? Uh at CES this week, they made some changes or updates to this network or this ecosystem. So now you can actually you can see here a breath of highly optimized open models that were previously required data center to run can now be accelerated uh at the desktop with the DJX spark or the station right and that is pretty cool and I wanted to just mention quickly too that uh we also did a video on the Neotron model that is also pretty nice to run on the spark if you wanted to just do some local maybe some AI coding or something like that. Uh but one thing I noticed is that uh the latest kind of I tested out the latest video model from light the LTX2 video model and it uses NVFP4 that is supported by the Spark and that just makes a huge difference in how you can kind of quantize these models for running on the Spark and it's super cool to test out this how much how much you can get out of this uh by using this new format here the FP4 format and I also wanted to mention that NV has partnered with Mistral to accelerate a new family of open models, the Mistrol 3 family and on Hugging Face, you can find a ministral tree models if you wanted to run them. So yeah, pretty cool update if you are owner of the Spark. So I have a link in the description. Go check it out and yeah, look out for more on this soon, I guess. >> Hello. So uh I heard a lot about skills and how how is that kind of compared to should I use skills over MCP or should I use both? uh you don't have to go into detail, but could you just show me kind of how I [music] can use skills uh instead of MCP? Uh I mostly just run this locally, so I don't see the difference, right? Uh by using skills versus MCP since most of my work is done locally on cloud code anyway. So yeah, just an example of skills. Thank you. >> Okay. Yeah, that's another good question. So I would say if you go to cloud code and look at kind of skills I would just say there's not like a big difference from uh MCP. Of course there are some differences but basically I think like if you're just going to do things locally I prefer skills right because it kind of reduces all the context you you don't build so much overhead of context and it's just used when you need it. So I thought we can just show you kind of how you can make a quick skill. So, I'm just going to copy the documentation here from Claude and paste it in. And let's open up Claude here. And let's try to build like the simplest skill we can do. So, I can just say read uh let's tag the skills documentation, right? And create a skill that always creates a smiley smiley face in ASI or something. If user ask for a smiley, right, that is a very smiley, very simple skill, right? You can create. Uh, of course, this could be anything. It can be running code. Uh, it's just very efficient at what it do because it doesn't really create overhang. So, now we're going to create this uh cloth skills smiley face. And we're going to put this in our directory. So, this skill is only going to apply locally. It's not going to be a global skill this time. So yeah, we're going to write this. Uh maybe this is a global skill. Okay, that doesn't really matter too much. So now we have created our skill. Uh you can see we kind of created if we expand this a bit this. So if we expand this a bit, you can kind of see the skill here. So we have a name for it. It's called smiley face. And the description is what the agency see right creates a art smiley face when the user ask for a smiley smiley face happy face or want to see a smile. So all of these are kind of trigger for the skills and down here the here we can see the different kind of smiley faces we want. Right? So this is what uh the claw code is bringing into context when the user ask for this. So we can try to test it out now. So uh if I close code now, right? And we just start a new session, right? So we load in we create a new cloud code session and I said I need a smiley face. So now cloud code should understand that it needs to use the skill, right? Let's see if it picks up on the skill here. Use skill smiley face. Yes. And yeah, here's the smiley face, right? So you can see uh it just used the context we gave it and it created the back the smiley face we saw in the description and this does not make any overhang and it doesn't create a context. It doesn't mix with the context. So it's only when this triggers we kind of get the response back. So this is very efficient if you doing something you can create a skill just to create an image. So you kind of put in the code you need maybe you have some API keys and stuff like that and it only going to trigger when you ask for this type of image. So yeah, it's a very efficient way. MCP is a bit different because you can use it for O. Maybe you need to connect some kind of remote stuff and that I would use MCP and you can also mix skills with MCP if you wanted to do that. Uh but yeah, pretty cool feature. I use it a lot locally on like simple task I do repetitively. So hopefully that answer at least some of your question. So yeah, let's take uh question four then. >> Hello Chris, hope you are doing well. So, I hear a lot about sub agents and I've been testing out CL code, but I haven't really used a lot of sub agents. I don't really get the point. Why can't I just use the main agents? So, could you just show me an example of sub agents and how I use them and why I should, I guess. So, yeah, thanks for the videos and have a nice day. Yeah, that's a good question because sub agents is something that has been more and more implemented into claude uh code because now it's more autonomous than it was before. If we do slash agents, we have the opportunity to create our own sub agents too. Uh but there are some builtin sub agents now. So here you could create like a a local sub agents if you wanted. Uh I think we're not going to do that. So I think a really interesting or like a simple way to check out sub agents is uh there's an agent called explore agent. So this is like a sub agent. So remember we had this skills documentation here. So I could say something like launch a explore sub agent to get familiar with the documentation in skills.md. So what is pretty nice about this is that um the sub agents they don't really take up any context right so you can see here's the explore agent it's going to read this and everything right so this can now go uh in a separate context window uh and it doesn't really take from our context window and when it has read and kind of come back to the main agent with everything so it's going to explore and summarize the documentation in this file file and since this does not does not add to our context window you can see here the tokens is not going up in our context window this means that we can get more information by launching these sub agents so there are a few built in I think it's like the web sub agents that can do search and we have the explore one so this is this this use 22,000 tokens but it doesn't really pass on to our main agent here right but you can see we get like a nice thing that was passed on to the main agent with kind of the most important parts of the information. So I at least use sub agents to explore different documentation to kind of get some uh exact knowledge from that documentation without bringing it into our main context window here in cloud code and we can get more high signal information into the context window without bloating it right with the information we doesn't need right so yeah that is how I use sub agents and hopefully that is uh somewhat of an answer so let's do the final question then. >> Hello Chris. Uh my question for the Q&A is uh I guess it's two questions. Hope that's all right. So how do you handle context in cloud code? Uh could you just talk a bit about that? Just show me. And the last question is I see a lot of people running like cloud code uh very fast. But when I try it, I get like a a lot of pop-ups. So I have to answer a bunch of questions and I can't really leave my computer. So could you just show me how I can run this fully autonomous? H is there a way to do this? And yeah, thank you for the videos and I yeah have a great day. Okay, so I think the first part of your question about context we kind of have already answered in this video already. Uh but I guess I could show you like quickly. So you can see I have my documentation folder. This is kind of my workflow. So if I have a project, I know what kind of documentation that needs to go in this. I know I need skills documentation from Antropic. Uh let's say I needed to gather some more documentation. Let's say I needed to go to fal because we're going to use a nano banana. And I'm just going to go to API here, right? I've done this many times before. Uh I'm going to do Python this time and I'm just going to grab the documentation from file here and I'm just going to create like a file AI file ai.md. And I'm just going to paste it in now. So now we can see we have two parts of documentation. I can just launch cloud and I can say something read docs in at uh I can just do docs right and now kind of cloud code is aware that we have all the information I could launch explore agents like I did if I have like a bunch of documentation that kind of exceeds the 25,000 token window. And this is kind of how I handle context. Now we kind of have the skills context. we have the file AI. So now the model is more suitable and will not make so much error when running uh yeah task based on this because it has availability to go read look up the documentation when we're going to build let's say a web app with uh images using Nana Banana Pro here from Falight. So this is the way I handle documentation but there are other ways to do it too. You could like have like an MCP or like a skills. Uh in that skill, you have a bunch of information about context. You can have an MCP server that connects like context 7 that connects to a bunch of different ways to bring in context. We also have this llm.ext files. Maybe you've seen those. You can bring in this markdown files with the context uh or documentation. And that's just the way I handle it. But there are a lot of other ways to do it too if you wanted to. And for the second part of your question that is a bit bit more interesting because you have probably seen people running claude in yolo mode right so I can show you like a simple example of this if you just leave here. So you have to go all the way out to the the terminal again and there's just this one command you can run uh that is called I can show you. So if you go to the documentation and we scroll down here you can find this flag here called dangerously skip permissions. So this uh I've seen a lot of I'm going to show you a post on this uh later. But basically this skip permission prompts. So it says use with caution. So if we launch code in this mode, right? If we go back to cursor here and we launch claude d-dangerously skip permissions, we get into this bypass permissions on. Right? And now we don't get any it won't ask us if you want to do this. Do you want to delete your full system? It doesn't going to ask yes or no. It's just going to do it. Uh so this is kind of the way you can. Yeah, I don't have any like big examples. But basically when we are in this mode, the cloud code is not going to stop and ask us if we want to execute this. So I can say create a snake game uh in HTMLJS and launch it right uh when code is done. So now it's not going to ask us it's just going to write the code and launch it. It's not going to ask me is this code good? Uh are you ready to launch this? Uh blah blah blah. All right. So let's see what happens now. So you can see I have bypass permissions and in theory now this should just write the code and launch the game. It should not ask me for any permissions to open up this in a browser or something like that. So it did write the code right and it should just launch it right and here we have the game. So you can see I guess that is kind of what you were asking for about this. So of course this saves you a lot of time and you can open up many of these in parallel. Uh but it also comes with a risk. Uh I will show you. So this Reddit post here, Claude CLI, the deal that my home directory, my entire home directory invite my whole MacBook. So if you go down here, this is of course I it has to be run in YOLO mode, right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was. Uh yeah, it probably was, right? So you can see down here there's a command uh remove uh our F and at the end there it has this, right? And this means that they deleted his whole MacBook. You can see this right on the end here. So, of course, you got to be very careful. You can see that at the end. So, you got to be very careful. Uh let's see if there anything about bypass permissions, but uh I'm pretty sure it has to be run in bypass permission here because if not, I guess he wouldn't approve this. So you got to be very careful when running clawed code in this bypass permissions on here. So uh it's pretty cool if you are kind of in a sandbox or something like that, but if you have some files you're really worried about, I would be a bit cautious about this. So yeah, that was basically my new format. Uh trying out some Q&A with kind of my video agents and I thought it turned out pretty good and I've been super impressed by that. Uh I'm going to talk about more how I kind of create these uh agents and how I plan to use them in kind of upcoming business videos. Uh but today I thought it was pretty interesting and it's pretty cool to see Cloud Code getting so much attention because I think it's worth it. Not worth it but deserved and it's not only applied to Cloud Code. There are other good ones too like uh Codeex and we have Open Code. I really want to mention Open Code because that is uh pretty cool if you ask me. And you can do open source models too. Uh I have a video on that coming soon that is going to be like local models uh running on open code using like your local hardware. Uh but cloud code getting a lot of popularity especially with the new Opus model and this is something I think is going to just be more and more popular in 2026. So hopefully this answered some of your questions and I had a really fun time making them. So yeah, thanks for tuning in. Don't forget to check out the stuff about uh the new GGX Spark from Nvidia down in the description.",
