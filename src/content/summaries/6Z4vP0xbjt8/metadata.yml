title: "Understanding A2UI: How AI Agents Build Real User Interfaces (Not Code)"
description: |-
  A2UI is an open protocol from Google that lets AI agents generate real, interactive user interfaces without writing code. Instead of generating React or Vue that you can't trust in production, AI describes UI as declarative JSON that your application renders using your own design system components.

  In this video, I explain:
  - Why current approaches to AI-generated UI fall short
  - How A2UI's declarative protocol actually works
  - The security model that makes it production-ready
  - How it differs from tools like Lovable and v0
  - A2UI Bridge: our open-source React implementation

  Official A2UI spec: https://a2ui.org
  Google's announcement: https://developers.googleblog.com/introducing-a2ui-an-open-project-for-agent-driven-interfaces/

  A2UI Bridge includes 75+ component adapters for both Mantine and ShadCN, so you can see the same AI-generated JSON rendered with different design systems.
