  What's really happening with AI scaling and the future of large language models? The common story is that bigger models mean better results — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on Ilya Sutskever's perspective on where AI research is heading:

  Why today's LLMs generalize worse than a bright teenager
  How emotions might be the missing value function in AI
  What the end of scaling means for frontier model development
  Where multi-agent ecosystems could become the real competitive moat

  For AI strategists and builders, the tension between scaling believers and research-first thinkers signals both opportunity and uncertainty ahead.
