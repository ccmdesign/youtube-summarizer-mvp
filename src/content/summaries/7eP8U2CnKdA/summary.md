## Key Takeaways

This video teaches core AWS services through a practical photo sharing app project.

- **VPC, IAM, EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, ALB, KMS, Secrets Manager, Cloud

Watch** are integrated into a real-world architecture with hands-on labs.

- Security is emphasized with **private subnets for databases**, **IAM roles for least permissions**, and **encryption via KMS**.

- The project uses **event-driven processing with Lambda** and **load balancing with ALB** for scalability and high availability.

## Summary

**Introduction**: The video provides a project-based tutorial on building a photo sharing app using 10 fundamental AWS services, with free labs for hands-on practice.

**Network and Security Foundation**: It starts with **AWS Regions** and **Availability Zones (AZs)** for geographic redundancy. A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is created with **public and private subnets** to isolate resources—public for the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and private for **EC2 instances** and **RDS databases**. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** enforces security through **roles** and **policies**, applying least privilege permissions.

**Core Services Integration**: **EC2** runs the backend API with **EBS storage**, while **Amazon RDS** manages structured metadata with multi-AZ deployment for fault tolerance. **Amazon S3** stores uploaded photos, using pre-signed URLs for secure access. **AWS Lambda** processes images event-driven, triggered by S3 uploads, without managing servers.

**Advanced Features and Monitoring**: The **ALB** distributes traffic and performs health checks, serving as a single entry point. **AWS KMS** encrypts data at rest in S3 and RDS, and **AWS Secrets Manager** securely stores credentials like database passwords. **Amazon Cloud

Watch** monitors metrics, logs, and alarms across all services for observability.

**Hands-On Learning**: Each section correlates with free labs on Kode

Kloud, allowing learners to implement concepts and receive instant feedback, reinforcing practical skills.

## Context

As cloud computing dominates modern infrastructure, mastering AWS services is critical for developers, Dev

Ops engineers, and cloud architects. This video addresses the need for practical, project-based learning to build scalable and secure applications, aligning with trends in cloud-native development and the growing demand for hands-on cloud skills.
