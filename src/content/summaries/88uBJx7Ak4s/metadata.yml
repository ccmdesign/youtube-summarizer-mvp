  Your customers aren't finding you the way they used to. Traditional
  funnels—landing pages, email sequences, and retargeting ads—are being replaced
  by a new, fragmented journey. If you’re still marketing like it’s 2023, you’re
  invisible to your customers.


  In this video, I’m breaking down the 5 major consumer trends for 2026 that are
  fundamentally shifting how people research and buy products. From visual
  search taking over Google to AI becoming the first destination for shoppers,
  you’ll learn exactly what you need to do to stay competitive.


  What You Will Learn:


  - Visual Search Mastery: Why 20 billion monthly searches on Google Lens mean
  your product imagery is now your most important SEO asset.

  - Live Shopping Strategies: How to compress the decision timeline and turn
  browsers into instant buyers using platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

  - AEO (Answer Engine Optimization): How to structure your brand’s data so
  ChatGPT, Rufus, and Perplexity actually recommend your products.
