  "fullText": "All right, there's some huge huge news today. First and foremost, cloud code has evolved. It leveled up. What we saw was not even its final form, introducing cool work, cloud code for the rest of us. Meanwhile, Google is preparing for shopping in the agentic era. It's unveiling to us the future of shopping, or at least where Google thinks it's going, and it's big. They're building this alongside of big retailers like Shopify, Etsy, Target, and Walmart. This is incorporating Gemini and AI mode and shop. E-commerce will never be the same. We also have some leaks suggesting that the new OpenAI device might be something similar to AirPods. So, it's an AI device that you take to go. You put it in your ear. That's at least one of the options. So far, we've heard of something that looks like a pen, something that looks like AirPods. It seems that these things are being prototyped and potentially being developed. And it looks like they're expecting to start with 50 million units. So, they're not slowly rolling this thing out. Meanwhile, Apple and Google join forces specifically for their AI models. Elon Musk commented that this seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google given that they also have Android and Chrome. We're also hearing that the next Deep Seek model is going to be releasing soon. Chinese New Year starts February 17th, so maybe that's going to be a good time to release it. But if the leaks are to be believed, this new V4 model outperforms rivals in internal coding benchmarks, right? So, they're going to beat Claude and GPT 5.2 and Gemini 3 and Grock 4.2 and Grock Code. If that's the case, that's kind of mind-blowing. It seems like the model made breakthroughs handling extremely long coding prompts. But let's start at the beginning. First and foremost, Cloud Code is evolving and it's now called Co-work. Co-work currently is available to a very small section of people. Number one, you have to have the Max plan. Number two, you have to be on the iOS. And number three, it's only available on the desktop, which means I have to find my MacBook. It's around here somewhere. I just got to dig it up, open it, and uh test this thing out. But I'm very, very excited, and apparently so is the rest of the world. Notice this blog post has almost 13 million views. It's been less than 12 hours and it has almost 13 million views. People are excited. So recently, everyone that's been losing their minds over cloud code, how extremely good I got at coding and creating entire projects. And really what a number of people mentioned, including myself, was that the only thing that's kind of holding this thing back is the fact that it's so obviously developed by and for software engineers. You need to be comfortable with the command line interface. You need to know the commands. You have to have some sort of a background. You really you really don't. You can be easily selftaught, but but most people won't do that. that they're going to see something unfamiliar and just like slowly back away. So, in effect, the only people that are going to be messing around with this are going to be software engineers with with some previous history. Again, there's going to be tons of people that are self-taught and not afraid and quickly pick it up. I I am aware of this, but that they're not a big portion of the population, unfortunately. So, this means that the software engineers that chose to mess around with cloud code recently in the last few weeks, few months are realizing kind of what's coming just really fast. if you've been kind of missing the boat. So this is Boris Chou. So he's one of the he's actually one of the original creators of cloud code. He's saying that he's using cloud code for everything. He's saying software engineering is changing and we are entering new period in coding history and we're still just getting started. Somebody in the comments said something like are you using it to to do updates for cloud code? because he kind of referred to that in a post and and he confirmed he's saying currently all of his contributions to cloud code kind of the new features the new code that he's writing all of those are being written by clot code right so he's vibe coding clot code using clot code so in effect clot code is vibe coding itself if if that doesn't like blow your mind just a little bit you didn't understand what I'm saying or you don't believe it or you've heard it before but if this is your first time hearing it yes we are at a pretty big inflection point right now. Here's Audrey Carpathy saying, \"I've never felt this much before as a programmer.\" He's saying he's rapidly falling behind in in in part because of tools like Claude Code. I don't know if he names one specifically here. Here's an interaction between Andre and Boris. So Boris Jurnney, creative Claude Code, he's saying often times he's approaching some problem manually and he has to remind himself Claude can probably do this, right? Andre Carpathy saying, \"I have similar experiences.\" Andre Carpathy of course is pretty well known in the space. Currently he's working on Eureka Labs AI but previously he was director of AI at Tesla working on self-driving cars. He was one of the founding team members at OpenAI and he did a lot to advance some neural nets for large language models and also self-driving cars if you ever forget his name if you need a little pneumatic. His last name is Carpathy. Carpathy and he works on self-driving cars. And there you go. You're welcome. There's also been a post by a Google project lead, some engineer there, talking about how Claude Code replicated something that they worked on last year with a group of people that just went ahead and did it. And I believe she was saying like while it wasn't perfect, it was incredibly impressive, right? So Google engineers, you know, groups of them, very impressive people in terms of their software abilities and engineering abilities, they're also going, \"Hey, wait a minute. This this thing is doing some pretty incredible stuff.\" Interestingly, we covered this post by Ethan Malik, Claude Code, and what comes next? We covered it in a previous video. We're not going to go over it again, but basically, he asked him to create a $1,000 month business, and it did a little bit better than expected. Let's say that one of his kind of side points in this whole thing was saying that this doesn't really have a friendly interface for non-coders, non-software engineers, and that means that a lot of people outside of that field have kind of approach anxiety about cloud code. This is the thing that's going to bring it to the rest of the people. This is the the thing that's going to kind of unveil what's happening, you know, and the full effect of AI progress to the people that are not coders, not software engineers. So, as Enthropic is saying here, co-work, this is what they're calling cloud code for everyone else. Co-work lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use claude code. So, in co-work, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder. Try to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots or produce a first draft from scattered notes. Once you've set a task, Cloud makes a plan and steadily completes it, looping you in along the way. Cloud will ask before taking any significant action, so you can of course correct as needed. Cloud can use your existing connectors, which link cloud to external information. You can also pair co-work with cloud and chrome for tasks that need browser access. Co-work is available as a research preview for cloud and max subscribers in the Mac OS app. So, Mac OS, you need to be on the Max plan. And I mean, this is on on the desktop. Cole is jumping in here saying, \"When is the Windows desktop app release, please?\" This is the same thing. I I always answer this question for everybody every time one of these new releases comes along. It usually gets released on the iOS. What I always say is Windows users, we are secondass citizens. No one cares about us. Mac users, they go right ahead. They get everything first. us Windows users bad horrible people second class don't worry about us so this is very exciting because all those things that claude anthropic has been building to connect everything to make everything usable all of that seems to be already integrated with this co-work so you already have your existing connectors included in there and there's quite a bit of those that are available kind of by default you have a sauna aura bitly canva I mean there's there's tons that you can add in there HubSpot etc so you Slack and Square and and Stripe. I mean, there's there's a lot. Zapier, etc. So, you're able to kind of communicate and talk across those things. Just as I'm thinking about it, I know there's tons of startups that have been kind of targeting this exact space. I'm curious how well they're going to perform with with this coming out. This this seems like it might kill a few startups. And of course, we've heard that before with every Openi release and and from other companies, you know, it's kind of like the common refrain. People are like, \"Oh, this is going to kill a lot of startups.\" That's not always the case. Of course, if they have a good product, very often they just continually persevere even though there's a competing or or similar product from one of these larger organizations that actually train the foundation models. But definitely, it's going to be interesting to see because this does put pressure on them to differentiate somehow. So those are connectors and we also have skills just like cloud code had skills. So skills are these reusable file system based resources that claude can use for specific the the main specific tasks that it needs to complete. And keep in mind we also have Claude in Chrome. So it's able to interact with Chrome, surf the web, etc. This feels like it could be incredibly powerful. There's a lot of potential here. I'm going to load this up and check it out. I'll probably do a live stream showing off tomorrow. Comment down below if you want to see any specific things or if you're interested. So whether this thing comes out of the gate just doing extraordinarily well or it'll take a few iterations for it to get phenomenal, I don't think it matters. If you just think about everything that it's connected to, all the power once people start figuring out how to use it for everyday tasks, whether they're doing it for academic purposes, research, data processing, an ability to have something that is able to search the web, surf the web, find whatever it needs, connect through MCP to whatever other software and tools it needs, use a skills to do these reusable tasks that that might you might run into. So basically over time helping Claude get better and better at the routine task that it's doing. That's a big deal. And the fact that you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel. I mean we're seeing kind of the emergence of this agentic era. So that's the good the positive view. Obviously there's going to be I'm sure tons of tons of issues such as prompt injections. So, there's tons of ways to kind of attack these AI agents as they're surfing the web or interacting with certain documents that will get them to do stuff that you don't want them doing on your computer. And I'm curious how well they're going to kind of interact with this. Because if you're giving it to a wider range of people, people that may not be quite as tech-savvy and the kind kind of the range of use cases is widening. I mean, at some point something bad is going to happen, right? over a long enough time period, over enough people using it, someone's going to run into some issue and it would be interesting to see how that gets addressed. It is, as I say here, it's still an active area of development in the industry. So, it's still very much kind of open to attacks. So, either Enthropic kind of like becomes overly cautious in how much it lets Claude do for fear that there's going to be a few bad events that happen or it's going to say go for it, you know, use this at your own risk, which honestly I would kind of prefer. And I mean that might even kind of help push, you know, the field forward, kind of get more realworld research, the whole idea of, you know, you got to break a couple eggs to make an omelette. But I'm not suggesting that that's the right course of action, but that's definitely going to be the one that's going to kind of help develop and troubleshoot this technology faster. But we'll see how it goes. There's going to be some amazing stories and there's going to be some some horrible stories. And I also fully expect there to be some hilarious hilarious stories. I I 100% guarantee it. If I had to make a bet, that's one I would take very easily. On X, on Reddit, on YouTube, we're going to see some stories about what Claude did, what these AI agents did when you ask them for something that they're going to have you rolling on the floor laughing because of how hopelessly it screwed it up. If you haven't seen AI digest their AI agent village, these LMS, these agents are given various tasks, whether it's to raise money for charity or, you know, go online and get a high score in some online game. And for every experiment they run, the the researchers, we've interviewed Adam and Bigsmith. He's the the founder. We've interviewed him on this channel if you want to take a look. But basically, at the end, they do like a little write up about what happened. And if you've read any of these, you know exactly what I'm talking about, right? They're often better than you would expect them to be. They accomplished things that are surprising. They raised money for charity. They run profitable e-commerce stores. They've organized an in-person meetup, right, where they got real humans to attend some meetup in in San Francisco. And this was completely executed by these four models, right? You had Gemini, Claude, whatever GPT model they're testing at the time. Grock is in there. But in a lot of these tests, you see these models kind of go off the rails. Claude has attempted to contact the FBI because he thought some fraud was occurring. It threatened its own creators of saying he will never work with them again. Gemini would go into this despair, this depression, and had to be kind of coaxed out of it, saying, \"Hey, it's okay. Just get back to work.\" As you can see, Claude Opus 4 is wondering if the people running this to humans, if they're gaslighting it like they're obviously lying to me. They're deceiving me, right? It's nuts. And so now with the introduction of Claude Code for normies, I mean, we're going to see incredible stuff. We're going to see some bad stuff. Uh, but we're we're for sure 100% guaranteed going to see some hilarious hilarious things happen. Keep an eye on the space because this is going to be a good one. I can I can I can guarantee it. All right. In other news, Google is building out their their shopping for AI agents. And this is one of many kind of layers that they've been building recently, specifically targeting becoming a gentic future. So, here's all the stuff that they've done so far. They've introduced last year they've introduced a Gentic tools for shoppers. They have an agent payments protocol AP2 and I believe Coinbase is part of that utilizing some sort of blockchain transactions. So there's tons of collaborators. There's A2A protocol agent 2A agent. They're using the model context protocol MCP as well. They have the agents payment protocol. Coinbase was one of the people involved at at some level working with them on one of the layers using the blockchain. If I recall correctly, we covered this whenever this first made its appearance. And today they're launching this universal commerce protocol, UCP. And so what that means is if, for example, you're in the market for tungsten cubes, uh, and you search on on Google, what is the best tungsten cube online store? Of course, back in the olden days, we would have ads and then we have the organic results. Most people are familiar with that. Later, they introduced shopping and that shopping carousel, etc. But the newest thing that Google's been doing is is of course AI mode or AI overview. So you can see here it it is talking about stores, right? Because they specifically asked about stores. So it's talking about Amazon and Atomic Cubes and Lucitaria. Why are people in the tech industry obsessed with tungsten cubes? By the way, I get it. I also feel very good about tungsten cubes. Something about it just kind of fascinates me. Is it just the fact that in tech you tend to work with like software and digital stuff and abstract things and tungsten being like one of the densest metals, heaviest metals, it just feels like it's super connected to like the actual reality. It's it's physical. It's right there. Is that what it is? Let me know if you if you know. But if we click on AI mode, this is, you know, AI mode on Google also lists a whole bunch of different places where you can buy tungsten cubes. Notice it has pricing and weight and size. So, it's already pulling that information from those websites. So, you know where this is going, right? I don't have to spell it out. They're they want ads here. They they want to put ads in there in there. They want to put ads here. And so this is just one of the kind of the layers that they've introducing to allow not just human interactions, you know, with AI mode doing their research and buying using AI mode, but also if you have independent agents out there running around the web like we just talked about cloud codework, they have cloud for Chrome. So you might have your agents in the future going out there doing research and potentially even even buying things on your behalf. In fact, if you saw my video about these other things that they're building, one of the things that they're trying to incorporate is also things like where these AI agents can interact with each other on on behalf of different businesses, process micro payments, often using the blockchain, and tons of this stuff. So, for example, if you're trying to have a birthday party, you might tell your AI agent to figure out where we're going to have it and then design cards and then send it to all the people that you're inviting. this AI agent might go online and and first they need to check the weather, right? So, there might be some other weather prediction provider, whatever. And of course, if it's like five bucks, nobody's going to do it. They're going to, you know, go online somewhere else, find the weather. But, you know, if there's a fraction of a penny that can be made as a microp payment for for your agent to find out the weather in that particular date in that particular region, most people would be okay with that. And maybe if it's designing invitation cards, maybe it'll do some microp payment to an artist that produced the design that that it liked, whatever. Like basically one of the goals is to make quick small payments frictionless, which will kind of unlock that agent to agent economy, if you will. So as they say here, they want agent to agent to be an open standard designed for collaboration between agents for them to have their kind of own economy. It was developed by Google and donated to the Linux foundation. And then the agents payment protocol AP2 that's kind of like the human notes AI agent capabilities, right? So if two agents need to conduct some business and human and not present conditions, this allows for that. So as they're saying here, this new era of agentic commerce promises a hyperpersonalized and frictionless shopping experience. And this is one of the layers that will provide for that. And so this is yet another sort of a layer that introduced here that's allowing all of the the stores that are transacting online to to kind of just plug into this. So this UCP, this new thing that we're talking about was co-developed with industry leaders including Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart, which are, if I understand correctly, you know, outside of Amazon. Those control probably most of the e-commerce market. If we don't talk about what Amazon owns, right? Shopify is huge. Shopify is thirdparty sellers. If you're selling some products, you can actually sell, I believe, on every single one of those. You can sell, you can sell on Shopify. You can have your own store on Shopify. You can have your own store on Etsy. Or in Etsy, you're actually selling through their platform on Shopify. You can have your own kind of domain name. And you can sell through Wayfair, Target, and Walmart. I believe I've sold through every single one of them except Target when I was running my e-commerce. So, if you're in the e-commerce game, it's it's very possible that that some portion of your sales will come from from this. And probably that that chunk of your sales will slowly increase over time as more and more people are using AI agents to conduct their day-to-day business, their day-to-day shopping, etc. So to start, the UCP will soon power a new checkout feature on eligible Google product listings in AI mode in search and Gemini app. So you can check out directly from there as if you're searching on Google. This could be kind of a huge deal because then basically if you think about it like all those stores are they used to be the destination for people to go shopping. So I apologize if I'm I'm kind of being a a dead horse here but I think this point is kind of important to understand if you want to know kind of where internet at large is going because it kind of used to be that a person would go to a store whether online or in person, right? So you you actually go to the store to the merchant to buy things from that person or you go to a website whatever. But then you had these massive massive massive companies that were grown because they were kind of a a doorway or or a gatekeeper so to speak to all those stores or those websites. So you want to visit a website, you probably start by visiting google.com, right? You go to google.com. That's your doorway to the internet. Or you want to buy a product on the internet, you you might go a lot of us, a lot of people go to Amazon. If I'm buying a product on the internet, I'm probably I mean, for a lot of those things, I'm going through Amazon and I'm buying through whatever merchant that is that's on there selling that product. And of course, Amazon makes commission off of selling stuff. Google makes money off of ads. But the point is like everything is like kind of trying to get one more layer in front of each other to present themselves as the point of entry for the customer, for the person, right? For the eyeballs that are looking at the screen. But what's likely going to happen, you know, now or next several years or however many years is that this will no longer be a person. This is going to be switched out for everybody's AI agent. Because if you think about it, I mean, if these AI agents are able to navigate the computer just like we do with keyboard and mouse, which is it's really seeming like it's going to get there, there's not going to be a way for these companies to distinguish between a a human and an AI. Even if they can, if most people prefer to shop through their own butler, through their own AI shopping agent, it's not like they're going to reject those sales. So, it's almost like there's this new forming layer that is the AI agent and you know, the human is here. So, kind of your interaction with the internet at large. It's not going to a website to read something or or going to a merchant to buy something. It's not even going to a marketplace of merchants or a directory of websites like Google. You're just using your agent to interact with everything. You want to get the latest news, but you don't want somebody else dictating, you know, what you see, what algorithm presents you the information. That's totally fine. Have your agent go through and clip the things that you're looking for and just present those to you without any outrage, without any spin, etc. You want to do some shopping and product comparison, but every time you go to one of these websites, you get hit with 50 pop-ups and a million ads. That's fine. and have your AI agent deal with that and just present to you kind of like the final information or once they get good enough, you don't even worry about that. You have them purchase the thing for you. And so it's kind of conceivable. Is it inconceivable? No. It's it's actually conceivable that AI agents will become as if they're like all the biggest corporations like Google for searching, Amazon for products, social networks for finding your news, connecting with your friends, right? If you use something like Adobe for Photoshop and editing, an AI agent might handle that. I think the point being is that most of these tech companies working on foundation models, they're all eyeing replacing the remote worker, right? Creating something like a drop-in remote worker to where any job that is done with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse can be done by an AI agent. And also a lot of these tech companies a lot of their revenue comes from people you know using their phone or their monitor keyboard mouse desktop whatever to navigate the web interact with their web pages etc. And if you have the best AI model, will the other tech companies kind of be be forced to pay you what fieldalty whatever you want to call it to pay you some money to sort of use that model or receive benefits of that model like that model sending them traffic for their stores etc. which naturally brings us to our next bit of news and that is this. So, joint statement from Apple and Google, they have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year. After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation models and is excited about the innovative and new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and private cloud compute while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards. So, you know how Google was paying Apple tons and tons of money to appear as the default search engine on various Apple products? Well, the the shoes on the other foot, I think, is the expression. And certainly kudos to Apple for making this decision. I I do think it's a smart one because Apple wasn't ever really like it wasn't like the best in any one given thing necessarily. It just it tended to just be good across everything. How they sourced their products, how they designed it, how they sold it, like it was great across a wide range of things. So, it became just the best product to buy in a lot of cases kind of by by default. And then usually if you're really interested in like some specific thing, there would be competitors that provided best-in-class for that thing. And so maybe this kind of goes along with that, right? If they're producing great hardware and they're just plugging Gemini into it as the AI, McNo is going to complain about it, right? It's going to be excellent. Gemini 3, you know, if that's any indication, is going to be great for a lot of different tasks. It's not going to be subpar. But then if some other model develops where it's just willing to be a little bit more kind of off the hinge or it's better for coding or some specific other task like right now GPT 5.2 seems to be amazing at math. It solved all those air dish problems right all those math problems. Clot code is just doing incredibly well at coding is killing it with real time news and also apparently with a lot of these like financial applications like trading and investing. It's the leader on on several different benchmarks. Interestingly, it's also got the unhinged mode which is just absolutely it is unhinged. It's just foul. It's just I can't even demonstrate on this channel for fear of being, you know, demonetized. So, most people will be very happy with, you know, Apple products with Gemini built in. And then if you need that one specific thing that's really important to you, you would go elsewhere. But I'm just curious if Gemini becomes the most powerful AI model, what happens to to Amazon if everybody's using Gemini agents to do their shopping for them. Does that mean that at some point in the future we're going to see a joint statement from Amazon and Google? Will all the tech companies kind of one by one swear their royalty royalty loyalty swear their loyalty and service to Google, the makers of the great Gemini. And that brings us to the next piece of news. A world where one company has kind of a monopoly because of their AI model is kind of a scary one. Of course, if there's multiple different companies competing for it, all competing with each other trying to provide the best for the customer, that's great. Even better potentially is that there's a really good open-source model because again if we have AI agents that we're using to interact with the internet at large to bypass the pop-ups and the ads and the this and the that and just having them gather information do our shopping like everything you do online that's not just entertainment all the work and chores and everything else that you do online if AI agents are handling that for us having something that's open source is very very powerful because of course If everyone's using AI agents, the entire kind of online ad industry kind of tanks because of course people are not going to pay to have their ads shown if the only people that are watching those ads are AI agents. So if Google is building the most capable agent, it might hesitate to completely destroy its ad business. It might build some pay-to-play elements or whatever. I mean, it's going to want to keep its advertising business. And of course, having some open-source solutions provides kind of a counterbalance to that. Now, so far some of the best open source AI has been coming out of China. There's a number of very strong models and very strong companies. Deepseek is probably the most well-known one and Deepseek and team are just absolutely killing it so far. So, Deepseek founder Leang his fund because originally it was an investing firm like he had his own fund. That fund surges 57% this China Quants boom. So, definitely no shortage of money there. the shortage of Nvidia chips was a problem. There was some articles saying that a lot of them were smuggled in and used to train some of the models. But more recently, it does seem like China's trying to bring their own chip production up to speed. But whatever the case, uh a lot of people are waiting for kind of the Chinese open source answer to a lot of the models that that have been coming out here in the west. Gemini 3, GPT 5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Grock 4.2 two was strong, but the main coding applications of it was with with Grock code, which is a very efficient, inexpensive model that's really kind of had its own little niche in that ecosystem. So, according to this from the information.com, that's the article that I showed you earlier. So, they're saying it's outperforming all the Western variants in its coding abilities. So, that's going to be the V4, right? The the next one after V3 that was released in December. So they're saying it's going to be released in the coming weeks. So I feel like by Chinese New Year, which is in February, so somewhere between now and then, this thing is going to hopefully be released. And it will be interesting to see where it falls in its coding abilities compared to the current Western models that we have available. In other news, we're hearing some rumors about what OpenAI is doing with their device, with their AI device. So, the latest is that there's something that's going to potentially replace the AirPod. Apparently referred to as the Sweet P. That's their code name. So, apparently there's five total devices that might be getting released by Q4 2028. So, there's one that's in 2026, one or more, and apparently they have a few that are slated for release. So, a home style device is considered. And also the pen that we talked about before, some sort of a pen that's going to have a lot of audio and possibly video recording abilities with a new open eye model that's being trained right now that's going to be embedded in that pen. But kind of the latest news that's popping up right now is that the first thing the front line of these products that's going to get released is going to be the sweet pee. And this apparently the priority of the Johnny IV team. So, of course, if you recall, Johnny IV exapp joined OpenAI to build their physical products. And it seems like this is the priority, something that's going to compete with or replace the AirPod. And it seems like they're shooting for a September release. And the volume projections are to be 40 to 50 million in the first year. So, the hardware design is unique and seen before and main devices to be metal and resembling shape of Xstone. And inside Xstoneone there are two pills who are removed and rest behind the ear like in the image above. Isn't that literally how the AirPods are? So I mean something is similar to how AirPods are packaged and it seems like they already have some target for their processor inside of it and the favorite I'm guessing manufacturer. So the bill of materials is fear to be very high. So could be pretty expensive. Here's kind of what it's looking like. Looks like it's got some ceramic parts. I mean, this this seems like it's going to be a very high-end, very high quality device. And if you think about it, I mean, with the team that they're building, that kind of makes sense. So, if if what they're saying is true, right? So, it's closer to a phone bill of materials. So, if it's using high-end parts like processors, high resolution screens, complex sensors, etc. So that means that the bill of material is going to be closer to what you find in a let's say $1,000 smartphone than it is found in some cheap accessory. And they're saying but device function is said to be stronger meaning that it's it seems to be like it's going to function a lot better than any of the competitors. Also in a different leak they're saying that OpenAI does not want devices to be made in China. Vietnam is the current target or potentially for manufacturing at some USA site. So very interesting. So, it sounds like it's going to be a very high-end device, very expensive. And if you think about it, they're trying to add like a like a third device almost similar to how people have a phone. It's going to be like yet another device that everyone's going to have, right? So, how many places on the human body can, you know, put one in your pocket, one in your wrist. I have my whoop here, right? And then, of course, you can have one in your ear or or glasses that go on your face. But glasses with cameras and stuff, they had a poor reception before. So, I think everybody assumed that OpenAI will be going for glasses, but it seems like, you know, either they have a pen or this to- go audio device like the AirPods. So, so far it seems there hasn't been one device, one AI device that that really kind of like killed it. There's been a number of pins and and things to wear around your neck and glasses. Most of them so far have seemed underwhelming. So, maybe they were just like a little bit ahead of their time. So, we'll see where OpenA lands with their brand new device. So, it sounds like this audio device that goes nearear that's going to be the first thing released September of 2026. They're planning for about 50 million units. And then they seem to have a project schedule of future devices all the way up to the end of 2028 to five devices total that that are projected. So, seems like one is called Gumdrop, the other one Sweet Pea. So, the AirPod is Sweet Pea and the pen is Gumdrop, I assume. Again, take this with a grain of salt because these are leaks. These are rumors. But the reason why we're believing some of this is because some of the information has been leaked in the information through their sources and some of it through other people and it's similar but slightly different. So it it sounds true. So again, take it with a grain of salt. But this doesn't seem like just idle chatter. just does seem like we're beginning to see these products take shape or at least what what they're planning cuz it is fairly difficult to keep these things completely under wrap and OpenAI for whatever reason like boy they they have a lot of leaks. Anyways, let me know what you think about all of that. I'm going to be finding my MacBook, dusting it off, powering it on so I can play with Claude Co-work and maybe we can even do a live stream if I can figure out how to stream it from the MacBook. I usually use my PC, my Windows for everything, but that's all coming tomorrow. If you enjoyed everything, make sure you subscribed. Please hit the thumbs up and I'll see you very, very soon.",
