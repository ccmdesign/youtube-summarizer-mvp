  _______________________
  What's really happening inside product management as AI reshapes the role? The common story is that AI simply makes PMs faster — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on why product managers face a unique AI crisis:

  - Why PMs face threats on multiple axes simultaneously
  - How building AI products differs from traditional product work
  - What core PM skills AI cannot replace or erode
  - Where to focus when everything feels like it's changing

  Product managers who ground themselves in technical AI fluency while protecting their product intuition will navigate this transition — those who outsource judgment to AI won't.
