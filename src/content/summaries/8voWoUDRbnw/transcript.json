Other products you can just sort of say this is what the product is and write the requirements and that's how we were all brought up if we were npm for a decade but not anymore. Now the product is probabilistic if you're building an AI product. The product is it mostly does this but sometimes there are edge cases. Sometimes the product is we figured this out. Can you help us package it? It is not easy to build AI product especially when you couple that with the demands from executives where executives are expecting really rapid ships on AI. They're expecting deadlines and your engineering team is like not willing to give you deadlines on probabilistic products so often. So there's the product piece, there's the asset piece. Both of those are very tricky. There's a third piece that no other role has, which is that PM has always been a glue role.",
