title: This Google Tool Turns Messy Text Into Clean Data
description: |-
  Most apps struggle with the same problem: messy text. A huge chunk of real-world data that's unstructured, and turning it into something usable is harder than it should be.

  In this video, I walk through LangExtract, a free, open-source tool from Google that helps developers extract structured, traceable data from unstructured text using large language models.
