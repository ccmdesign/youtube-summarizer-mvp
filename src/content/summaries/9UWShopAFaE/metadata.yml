description: >-
  Recent enterprise surveys show CEOs taking direct control of AI strategy as
  investments rise and ROI horizons shorten. Agent deployments are moving from
  experimentation to production while complexity, governance and cybersecurity
  challenges grow. Surveyed leaders report new AI-specific roles, shifting
  hiring priorities, and a move toward orchestrated agent ecosystems that demand
  CEO-led transformation.
