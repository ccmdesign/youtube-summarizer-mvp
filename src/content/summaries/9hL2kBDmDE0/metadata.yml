title: Stop Using Text. DeepSeek Just Proved Images Are Cheaper.
description: >-
  What if I told you that an image uses 20 times less memory than the text
  inside it? DeepSeek has just released a paper that fundamentally breaks the
  rules of how we process documents in Large Language Models.

  The "Context Window Tax" is the enemy of every developer building RAG
  pipelines or Agents. Text is expensive, and traditional OCR destroys valuable
  data like charts and layouts. DeepSeek-OCR proposes a radical solution:
  Contexts Optical Compression.

  In this video, we break down:

  Why raw text strings are inefficient for LLMs.

  The DeepEncoder architecture (the visual "funnel").

  Deep Parsing: How to turn bar charts and chemical formulas directly into code.

  The Blueprint: How to implement "Gundam Mode" and optimize your chat history
  today.
