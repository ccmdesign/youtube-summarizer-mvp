title: Claude Skills Just Fixed MCP's Biggest Problem (First Impressions)
description: |-
  Anthropic just released Claude Skills — and it might be the fix we've been waiting for to solve MCP's context window problem.

  Skills use progressive disclosure to only load information when Claude actually needs it, instead of filling up your entire context window before you even start. They're easier to build than MCP servers, can run code externally, and include a built-in skill creator to help you build your own.

  In this video, I share my first impressions — what it is, how it compares to MCP, why it's kinda MCP 2.0, and whether it actually solves the rate limit and context issues we've been dealing with.
