title: "MAID Runner x Claude Code: The Ultimate Workflow (Building an MCP Server)"
description: >-
  Master the MAID Runner methodology for AI-assisted development! This
  comprehensive tutorial demonstrates the complete MAID workflow using Claude
  Code - from exploration to parallel implementation.


  Learn how to structure AI-driven development with manifests, behavioral tests,
  and custom Claude Code sub-agents. I walk through each phase of the MAID
  methodology (Manifest → Behavioral Tests → Implementation) using a real
  project as demonstration.


  🎯 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:

  • MAID Runner CLI setup and project initialization

  • Using the spike command to explore requirements

  • Creating manifests for each development task

  • Writing behavioral tests before implementation

  • Custom Claude Code slash commands and sub-agents

  • Sequential task implementation workflow

  • Parallel implementation with multiple Claude Code agents

  • Integration and validation patterns


  ⚙️ METHODOLOGY PHASES DEMONSTRATED:

  1. Spike - Explore and validate ideas

  2. Manifest Generation - Define scope and artifacts

  3. Behavioral Tests - Specify expected behavior

  4. Implementation - AI-assisted coding with validation

  5. Integration - Combine completed tasks


  💡 DEMO PROJECT:

  I build a MAID Runner MCP server to demonstrate the methodology in action. The
  focus is on HOW to use MAID Runner, not what we're building.
