  "fullText": "Emotions are not decorative. So emotions are a simple robust signal about how good or bad a situation is. And long before you get an explicit success failure outcome, your gut knows. And Ilia takes that seriously and he maps it back to reinforcement learning. And he says at the end of the day, reinforcement learning only arrives at the end of an episode, right? And that's extremely inefficient because the value function estimates at each moment how promising the future looks. So if you have a gut sort of pit of fear in your in your stomach and you say don't walk down the dark alley, that is the opposite of the way reinforcement learning works. And Ilia's taking that seriously. I know this sounds silly, but Ilia doesn't think it's silly. What he's calling out is that we have a value function in our emotions, that m that pit of fear, that intuition that this is the right call and that that projects into the future and helps us to make really good decisions. Whereas reinforcement learning is fundamentally backwards looking and only rewards past activities. That gap, Ilia thinks, is at the heart of why human learning scales differently.",
