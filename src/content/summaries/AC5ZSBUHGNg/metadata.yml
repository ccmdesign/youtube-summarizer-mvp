title: "AI Now Trains Itself: The Agent0 Breakthrough"
description: >-
  We are hitting a wall in AI development: Human data is expensive, slow, and
  limits models to human-level intelligence. But a new paper titled "Agent0"
  introduces a framework for self-evolving agents that learn without any human
  intervention.

  In this video, we break down how Agent0 uses a "Teacher-Student" architecture
  and tool-integrated reasoning (Python sandboxes) to improve mathematical and
  general reasoning capabilities by 18-24%, starting from zero data.

  What you'll learn:

  Why the current method of training (RLHF) is a bottleneck.

  How Agent0 uses a compiler as an objective "truth teller."

  The 3 Pillars of the Agent0 architecture.

  A step-by-step blueprint to implement this training loop yourself.
