title: Docker’s Best Security Feature Is Now FREE
description: >-
  Docker just made a major shift by opening up their hardened images to
  everyone. This video breaks down why your base image matters more than you
  think, and how hidden vulnerabilities sneak in from the very first line of
  your Dockerfile. We'll show you how Docker Hardened Images work, how easy they
  are to use, and why they are becoming the safest default for modern container
  builds.
