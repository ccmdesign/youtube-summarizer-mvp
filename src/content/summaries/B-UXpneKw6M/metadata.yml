  We sat down with Boris from Anthropic to learn the claude code skills that
  separate beginners from power users. This claude code tutorial covers
  everything from verification techniques to running parallel sessions.


  You'll discover how to use claude code as a full orchestration system, not
  just for coding. Boris explains his claude code agents workflow, running 5
  sessions simultaneously and using background agents for long-running tasks. We
  cover claude code subagents for automating architecture verification,
  refactoring, and build validation.


  Wondering about claude code vs cursor? While cursor has its place, claude code
  desktop and claude code vscode integrations offer unique advantages for AI
  assisted development. We also address whether claude code free options exist
  and how to maximize value.


  Key topics include:


  The claude.md file structure Boris uses (only 2.5k tokens)

  MCP server integrations with Slack, Notion, and more

  Plan mode vs Auto Accept vs permissions management

  Using Opus 4.5 with Thinking for fewer errors

  GitHub Actions for automated PR reviews

  Verification led development with ai agents


  This isn't just prompt engineering theory. It's real artificial intelligence
  workflow from someone building ai tools at the frontier. Whether you're into
  chatgpt, cursor, openai products, or claude specifically, these coding
  techniques apply across the board.
