## Key Takeaways

Mig Reyes challenges the design industry to move beyond the "advocating for the user" phase and into a phase of **building excellent businesses**. He emphasizes that design's seat at the table is now a given at top companies, meaning designers must step up as **product leaders** rather than just flow-creators.

* **The Death of 'UX'**: Modern consumer companies like Airbnb, Meta, and Duolingo hire **Product Designers**. Labels like "UI/UX" are often seen as red flags for lack of seniority.

* **Management as Craft**: Great design managers must be former **excellent ICs** who can still jump into Figma and articulate the specific "why" behind visual and product details.

* **Visual Design is the Gate**: In consumer tech, portfolios are filtered by **visual execution** first. If the craft isn't there, recruiters won't bother reading the case study.

* **Reps over Decks**: Duolingo prioritizes **10-minute rapid reviews** and prototypes over long-winded documents or 30-slide presentations.

* **Invest in Early Talent**: Duolingo hires ~50% early-career designers to shape their mindset and maintain a **culture of learning** and adaptability.

* **Proactive Communication**: Influential designers broadcast their thoughts frequently. **Unpolished but frequent** communication is more valuable for career growth than rare, polished updates.

## Summary

### The Shift from UX to Product Experience
Mig Reyes begins by explaining why Duolingo rebranded its design organization from **UX Design** to **Product Experience**. He argues that the term "UX" has become archaic, often associated with a "boxes-and-flows" mentality where designers simply hand off wireframes to others. At high-maturity companies like Duolingo, being user-centric is an assumption, not a debate. The new title reflects a shared mission between design, research, and writing to build an excellent **product**. Reyes notes that prominent consumer companies have largely abandoned the "UX Designer" title in favor of **Product Designer**, which implies a deeper connection to business metrics, engineering constraints, and overall product strategy.

### Rebuilding Design Management
Upon joining Duolingo, Reyes focused on raising the bar for design leadership. He believes design management has devolved into "paper pushing" in much of the industry. To counter this, he rebuilt his team with leaders who were once **excellent individual contributors (ICs)**. These managers are expected to act as **studio heads**, capable of identifying exactly why a design feels off by a few milliseconds or a few pixels. They must balance three pillars: **Management** (taking care of people), **Product** (understanding metrics and roadmap), and **Design** (holding an insanely high bar for craft). By scaling himself through a leadership team that is deeply embedded in the work, Reyes ensures that the entire org remains trusted by the executive team.

### The Duolingo Product Review Culture
One of the most unique aspects of Duolingo's culture is the **Product Review** process. Unlike companies that have hour-long meetings once a week, Duolingo holds rapid-fire reviews **five times a week**. Each review is capped at **10 minutes**, forcing designers and PMs to cut the fluff. There is a strict ban on long decks and "explainer UI"; instead, designers must present **high-fidelity prototypes** directly to the CEO and other executives. This high-pressure environment provides designers with constant "reps," accelerating their growth and ensuring that the work is always aligned with executive expectations. After each review, the executive team debriefs to provide "meta-feedback" on how the team can present better next time, creating a tight coaching loop.

### The "Hard Truths" of Hiring
Reyes offers a blunt perspective on the current job market, stating that **visual design** is the ultimate filter. In the consumer tech world, if a portfolio does not demonstrate exceptional visual craft, it is often dismissed within seconds. He advises designers to stop over-indexing on process photos (like sticky notes on walls) and personas, and instead focus on the **final output**. Duolingo has even changed its interview process to require a "30-minute chat" with only five slides of high-fidelity work, mimicking their internal review style. He also warns that using the title **"UI/UX Designer"** can make senior hiring managers nervous, as it often suggests a designer who is far from the product's business and engineering realities.

### Investing in the Long Game
Despite the trend of hiring only senior talent, Duolingo intentionally reserves about **half of its hiring forecast** for early-career designers (new grads). Reyes argues that while senior talent is valuable, it can sometimes be "jaded" or resistant to change. By hiring junior talent, Duolingo can mold designers into their specific culture of learning. These junior designers are given the same high expectations as seniors—including presenting to the CEO—but with scaled project scopes. This "long view" investment has led to incredible retention, with many of the company’s current directors having started as junior ICs many years ago.

## Context

Mig Reyes is the VP of Product Experience at Duolingo and has held senior leadership roles at **Instagram** and **Basecamp**. This conversation comes at a time of significant upheaval in the design industry, as the post-pandemic market has cooled and the rise of AI is forcing a re-evaluation of the designer's role. Reyes’ insights are particularly relevant for designers struggling to find work or seeking to move into leadership, as he clarifies the shift from **process-oriented** design to **outcome-oriented** product work. His perspective represents the "new guard" of design leadership—one that prioritizes business impact, high-frequency iteration, and a return to high-fidelity craft as the primary measure of value. This video is essential viewing for anyone looking to understand the internal standards of a top-tier consumer tech company like Duolingo.
