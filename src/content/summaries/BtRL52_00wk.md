## Key Takeaways

This panel discussion from Smashing Magazine, featuring Geoff Graham, Michelle, Marcel, and Emily, explores practical approaches to fostering accessibility and critically evaluating the role of AI in inclusive design. The conversation highlights immediate actions individuals can take and strategic ways to integrate accessibility into organizational culture.

*   **Start with Simple Audits:** For personal sites, using the **tab key** to navigate exposes basic accessibility issues. For organizations, simply **asking questions** about current practices and thinking about accessibility is the crucial first step to initiate change.

*   **Educate Yourself and Observe:** Before diving into complex tools, **learn the basics of accessibility** and watch **user testing videos** showing diverse disabilities and assistive technologies to build fundamental understanding and awareness.

*   **Approach AI with Caution:** While automated tools can offer an easy entry point, **blindly trusting AI** is risky. AI often learns from a web that is 95% inaccessible, potentially reinforcing existing problems. Prioritize tools with **curated, valid knowledge bases** and use AI for brainstorming, not final decisions.

*   **Redefine Time and Budget:** Challenge the notion that accessibility "takes more time." Michelle argues it's about **intent**; accessibility should be an inherent part of project planning, not an add-on. Marcel emphasizes integrating it into **good UX/design/coding practices** from the outset.

*   **Advocate for Users and Understand Stakeholders:** Be prepared to **go against the grain** to advocate for users who aren't in the room. Emily suggests not taking pushback personally, but rather understanding stakeholders' **underlying fears and pains** to address them constructively and align goals.

## Summary

The panel discussion, hosted by Geoff Graham for Smashing Magazine, brings together Michelle, Marcel, and Emily to delve into practical aspects of "easy accessibility" and the evolving role of technology, particularly AI, in inclusive design. The conversation kicks off with a fundamental question: what is the easiest, low-hanging fruit action anyone can take to improve accessibility and establish a culture of inclusion?

### Easiest First Steps for Accessibility

Michelle begins by suggesting that for a personal website, the simplest step is to use the **tab key** on the keyboard to navigate through the site. This immediately exposes how accessible the environment is and prompts reflection on the vendor or build process. For organizational settings, the equivalent is to start **probing and asking questions** – both about the product and with colleagues – to initiate thinking about accessibility. She emphasizes that actions only follow if there's initial thought and awareness, moving beyond abstract discussions to concrete action plans. Michelle also advises reading your website aloud, which she gives clients, to better understand communication and user experience.

Marcel, whose company develops accessibility tools, recommends learning about the **topic of accessibility first** rather than getting overwhelmed by checklists. He highlights the value of watching **user testing videos** that demonstrate different disabilities and assistive technologies. This direct observation can spark deeper interest. While tools can provide an "easy entrance," especially for complex technologies like screen readers (which he cautions can drastically change phone interactions if not properly understood), they should support understanding rather than replace it. His tool, for instance, uses **gamification** to help users explore rules and visualize what happens, fostering a better understanding of criteria without the immediate pressure of a full audit.

Emily, focusing on design experiences, suggests starting by asking, "what can go wrong in the process?" She notes that businesses often fear accessibility initiatives as expensive and complex. Her advice is to **explore small, actionable lifts** yourself – like improving settings, notifications, or emails – and then present these concrete, low-effort ideas to stakeholders. This approach moves beyond theoretical discussions to demonstrate immediate, tangible improvements that can be implemented quickly.

### Trusting AI and Automated Tools for Awareness

The discussion then shifts to the role of AI and automated tools in streamlining accessibility efforts and fostering "empathy." Graham acknowledges the potential of AI for live translation and testing but also raises concerns about hallucinations, accuracy, and the wide range of human experiences AI might miss.

Marcel, whose tool incorporates AI, clarifies that their approach is to provide **recommendations and annotations**, with the human user always making the final decision. He warns against blindly trusting AI, especially since it learns from the current state of the web, where an alarming **95% of applications are not yet accessible**. Relying on AI trained on such data risks infusing and perpetuating existing problems. He advocates for tools with **scoped, curated knowledge bases**, like DQ's MCP, which offer valid and trustworthy learning data.

Michelle expresses caution, preferring the term **"awareness" over "empathy,"** as she believes empathy can lead to pity rather than true understanding, and fully grasping another's worldview is impossible. She argues that AI, being built on existing societal structures that haven't fully embraced human diversity, will reflect these inherent flaws. She references Dr. Hutah Ten's work on AI and disability, emphasizing the critical need to consider how AI is trained, its environmental impacts, and who it negatively affects before rapid adoption. While certain tools, like Otter AI for captions, can be beneficial, their positive impact requires conscious decisions by creators and stakeholders, a primary consideration she feels is often missing.

Emily shares Michelle's pessimistic view regarding AI's potential for systemic bias, citing an example of an AI health bot that gave drastically different advice to men (heart attack) versus women (panic attack) for similar symptoms. She stresses the importance of **critical thinking** when using AI tools, whether embedded in products or used for sense-checking. She explores **synthetic users** (fed with internal data) and the concept of **evals**, which set guidelines and test scenarios for AI to ensure it operates within defined guardrails. Interestingly, she finds tools like ChatGPT helpful for **brainstorming parameters and identifying overlooked scenarios**, suggesting a collaborative, critical use rather than full reliance.

### Overcoming Time and Budget Constraints

The final segment addresses the pervasive challenge of time and budget constraints when advocating for accessibility. Marcel emphasizes that communicating the **value of accessibility** and fostering continuous awareness is key. He frames accessibility not as an extra burden but as an inherent part of **good qualitative design and implementation workflows**, akin to following UX design practices or including diverse users. When integrated from the start, accessibility is not much more effort; problems arise when it's treated as a last-minute compliance task. He shared an example of his own company facing a lawsuit, which acted as a stark business case for immediate action, but stresses that a proactive culture avoids such scenarios.

Michelle advocates for a firm stance that accessibility is **not a compromise**. She challenges the common refrain "this takes more time" by stating that "time is based on intent." If there's no initial intent to include accessibility, then it will naturally *feel* like an added burden. She suggests **reframing conversations** to consistently integrate accessibility into project timelines from the outset, ensuring it's accounted for as an intrinsic part of the work, not an "extra thing."

Emily, drawing on her experience in challenging environments like startups and the gambling industry, highlights the necessity of being **okay with "going against the grain"** and advocating for users who cannot be present. She advises against taking pushback personally, instead urging advocates to **understand the underlying fears and pains of stakeholders**. By addressing these root causes, rather than repeatedly making the same argument, advocates can bridge the gap and achieve alignment, turning potential obstacles into opportunities for collaboration and progress. She points out that often there's a worry behind stakeholder resistance that can be alleviated by a well-reasoned, empathetic approach.

The panel concludes with Geoff Graham reinforcing the value of courage and consistency in advocacy, acknowledging that fighting for accessibility can be exhausting but ultimately worthwhile. He stresses the importance of understanding stakeholders' fears to build bridges rather than hit brick walls.
