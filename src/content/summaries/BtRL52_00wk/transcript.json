  "fullText": "[music] actually want to want to welcome folks back up to the the stage here. There's Michelle. And let's go ahead and Hey, um let's see. Do we have have Marcel coming up too? Yeah, here he is. Look at that. Look at this. It's like a full house all of a sudden. [laughter] Um, first of all, just thanks to each of you for your talks. I mean, I think we're all getting like amazing little gems out of each one of these talks that we're able to put into practice. Um, so like just thank you because what you're saying is valuable and what you're saying is important and what you're saying is helpful. So I just want want you all to know that. Um, and to kick off a panel discussion in general, like you know, I I'll I'll just start with with with something that that doesn't have a very clear answer to it because because why not, right? Um, but what is, you know, in in the scope of this this easy context, what is the easiest thing that anyone watching with us today can do to improve accessibility on their site or product? like like I I I mean I know we can implement a tool, we could do a continuous integration, we can start a survey, we could start thinking through you know you know different uh topics or like questions to ask but what would the most practical easy lowhanging fruit type thing be for someone who's looking to establish a culture of accessibility and create accessible experiences in their in their work? And I'll just open it up. Uh well you you know you know I'm going to start with Michelle because Michelle geez like you know when it comes to like planning and forethought whatever I thought that that was you know such such a directly related [laughter] um idea. >> Sure. Sure. Put me on the spot. Um of course I'll say this if if the product is yours like let's say you personally have a website like you have a website to promote yourself you're a student getting ready to graduate things like that. The easiest way to test for instance a website is to use the tab key on your keyboard, tab around and see what happens, right? So which then leads to expose yourself to how accessible is the environment that you're in. So if you have a personal website, did the vendor that you used or the way that you built it uh is that going to be accessible and how is that uh affecting your presence? Then if you abstract that to your part of an organization similarly start just probing either the product or the people are we thinking about this are we putting this into practice you're not going to fix anything you know day one or even day 20 as Marcel is showing you know things like that but the to me it's always it starts with thinking about it you know just like I loved Emily's talk as well if we're are if we aren't thinking about it the actions don't follows. So, anything that you can do to start thinking about it and then answering real questions. You know, people tend to talk about accessibility in the abstract and then nothing ever actually gets done or actually gets fixed. Um, they sort of talk about this ethereal we should be accessessible and then nothing gets done. So, the more that you can actually find out how accessible you are, uh, and then actually talk about action plans to put it in place, then it'll get done after that. So, like I said, the first thing is asking some questions. And of course, I research how to say that, but that's my answer. >> Well, well, well, of course, you know, like I've one of the the the common pieces of advice I give clients, whatever is read your website, you know, just read it and like like read it out loud even because that will give you an idea of like what you're communicating, how it sounds coming out, and what it sounds like coming in. Um, you know, to help account for some of those things. So even doing something as easy as going in and tabbing through will lead to like you know insightful interactions that that are like maybe we're missing a gap here or maybe there is a gap here that that we can close off. Now, now I want to turn that question over to Marcel as well because when we're talking about, you know, easy stuff, tooling and like automation is like is like clearly, you know, this like this like holy grail of like of like what we want, right? Like please machine do this thing for me and like and like like make everything accessible, right? Um that's like the failed promise of like accessibility overlays and [laughter] stuff like that too, right? Like let's just make it all accessible um in one fail swoop. Um but so so with a tool like yours, Marcel, what would you say, you know, might be uh might be a downfall for someone who's trying to uh you know to like establish a culture of of accessibility as opposed to like you know just running a report and just following a script. Um and maybe for for the first question wait what is easily uh applicable for everyone I would also say based on my personal experience and following up on Michelle's task um like doing something I would always recommend to learn a little bit about um the topic of accessibility first because like these checklists sometimes get you overwhelmed and you maybe then dig into rabbit holes not understanding the technology. ology what it actually is about. So what I really find valuable if you cannot do attend some user testing with people there are some great videos in YouTube for example seeing different kind of disabilities and assistive technologies and just watch what is actually happening then maybe it's raising your interest in exploring topics on your own. I would say with regards to ease of use and that's why we actually also build our tool. I mean for some of this technologies it's kind of easy. I would say tabbing is is quite easy for everyone to apply. But like with screen readers technologies, you also have to read through some documentations, learn how the interaction is basically changing. And keep in mind, do this before you actually turn on voice over on your mobile phone because interactions are totally changing rapidly. And I would recommend turn on Siri to turn it off or have a shortcut to turn it off again. Otherwise, you probably get stuck in your phone. >> Yes. as I think this this kind of part is not the easiest. Um so maybe their toolings uh can support you with getting an easy entrance to the topic. Just like with automation, it runs through gives you some information about some possible problems or with our tool you can basically just with kind of a gamification explore different kind of rules. maybe not with the intention to directly do a full audit and fix all this stuff, but getting used to the criteria and have a better understanding and also visualize what actually happens. >> Thank you. That's that's that's excellent perspective to uh to to incorporate in there. And Emily, like like to you especially, like I think the types of of experiences that you outlined there are the type that most of us aspire to in design, right? You know, we want to account for those little tiny micro interactions almost that don't just create delight, but they are considerate at the same time, you know, and that and that we can express, you know, some sort of human level to the thing that we're helping the user accomplish. um what's the easiest thing that someone here listening on the call today can um can can do to you know to to get started in that process. >> So try and say something something [clears throat] different to >> Oh shoot hold on one sec. I I think your your mic is is is dead. Hold on. Um maybe maybe Jiren can help me here. >> It says I'm >> I can I can hear Emily. >> Oh sorry I wasn't able to. I'm sorry. [laughter] >> Thank you. I was like, it says I'm speaking. Thank [gasps] you. But I'm gonna try and say something different to Michelle and Marcel because um I'll try my best. But I agree with everything they've both said. So the first thing the easiest thing you can do is just start asking what can go wrong in the process. Um just starting to bake that mindset in. But I think that um similar to Michelle's point is um I think when we talk about accessibility or inclusive design, it kind of scares businesses because they don't really know what that means sometimes and they think that it's going to be this really big expensive thing. And I think sometimes the easiest thing is to just kind of go away, have a play, and then come back and say, \"Hey, I've got this idea, and it's only going to be this, this, this.\" If you think about my talk, I showed you settings, notifications, and emails. Like, they're not the biggest features um from an inclusive design perspective. And you can actually just go away and say, look, I've rather than having that abstract conversation of we need to be more accessible, we need to be more inclusive, you can explore some of those things and say this is the smallest lift we can do, actually we could implement this tomorrow or something like that. and really trying to come with being a bit more actionable rather than living in like the theoretical land I think is sometimes really really helpful. Obviously that's under the assumption that you're already comfortable with accessible design and how to come up with more inclusive experiences. But I think sometimes just trying to give yourself a little bit of time, block out some focus time in your calendar and actually spend some time ideating on how could we move this to be a bit more inclusive is what what I would say if you can. I know not everyone always has time, but if you can just try and drive it forward yourself a little bit more. >> Well, like I said, for some reason I can't hear Emily like like everyone else can. So, I saw like like animated movements and and was like, I'm going to watch her mouth just make sure that like you know I I I know when she's done talking there. Um uh but [laughter] but you know just uh barring that um I also wanted to just um you know I covered that if there's one thing that we heard throughout all the talks it's that empathy plays a major role in avoiding finding and accounting for accessibility issues but at the same time we want this process to be easy right and we can see how technology might be used to streamline things so thinking about like AI and automated testing and live translation and stuff like that to what extent can we trust these tools tools to you know to help us develop more more empathy in our work because you know we you know we see that like AI has like has like hallucinations we we you know we we question uh the the accuracy of some of these things they you know they also don't consider all of you know the wide range of of the human experience. Um what do you see these tools ultimately uh streamlining and improving um that you're excited about in the future? And I'll just go and start with Marcelo because uh because a I can hear you and [laughter] and two um you you you develop a tool like this. >> Yes. Um and we also facilitating AI but we are really careful and always want uh people to have being the last in in the in the pipeline to choose. So we give some recommendations, we give some uh annotations but always people uh who then can decide. And the the problem or the thing with fully relying on AI technology is if you do not have an understanding for it, um you probably blindlessly trust in in the solution. And um I got a good quote um from CEO of DQ but she was also telling like AI is currently learning from the state of um the implementation in the worldwide web and 95% of the applications are not yet accessible. Um [clears throat] so like if you trust in this AI is currently learning from all of these issues out there then there probably will be a lot of problems also infused with AI suggestions and stuff if you do not scope it and if you do not have any understanding if it's actually true or not. So what I really recommend is also having some toolings that have a really good scoped knowledge base. Um Andy was introducing this with the MCP of DQ. So there you can trust that the actual learning uh of this data is uh curated and valid and not just grabbing the data from anywhere out the web. >> Michelle, I want to turn that over to you as well because because I see a lot of of what you were talking about is being very manual. you know, we have surveys, we have uh, you know, we're we're collecting more qualitative um, information and as a researcher, of course, that makes sense for you. You know, you want to, you know, to get nuanced information, not just surface level. Um, how do you see technology um, improving or streamlining things in a way that that you're excited about in the future? [sighs and gasps] >> So, first of all, I'll clarify. I don't use the word empathy. Um, I find that empathy leads more to pity than understanding. So I tend to use the word awareness. I think it's also nearly impossible to understand someone else's worldview. I just, you know, I don't live that life. So um all the all that comes with whatever situation someone is in is never going to be able to be translated to another person. But I think we can have more awareness of these differences and believe people when they say something doesn't work or something doesn't fit. Um so therefore though because we come from a society that has yet to really embrace that uh no matter where we are in the world I think everyone has this issue of of not quite yet being okay with the diversity of the human experience AI is going to be reflective of that as well. So, I'm not entirely enthusiastic about what certain tools can do because if they're built on what we've done so far, then there's going to always be a natural flaw to that. Um, so I'm going to put in the in the main chat a a name uh Dr. Hutah Ten. Oh, I always t always mess up her last name. I love her perspective on AI and disability and just all the cautions that um really need to be brought up with how it's trained, the environmental impacts, who it negatively impacts before we just sort of jump on board with all the things that are trying to really get pushed to us. um and really understand even why are they getting pushed so hard and so fast without um a lot of thought even you know I thought we would have learned by now not to do this right where we're supposed to be more cognizant of the impact of technology and yet here we go again so um those are some of the things yes certain tools like we're using Otter AI for the captions um you know there are certain ways that any tool you know whatever it is um can be used for good and for the benefit of people and for more inclusion where maybe there wasn't before. But that has to be a conscious decision. And I've yet to see where decision makers are always thinking about that as the primary decision. So that's why I'm just cautious right now. It makes me think we can actually uh include some of Emily's wisdom here and ask what can go go wrong with the with the technology when we're actually using it ourselves, right? Because, you know, there might be limitations that we need to account for and think about or to your point be aware of, right? It's not just uh about empathy. Um it's about awareness. And I really like that that distinction. Thanks for that. Um Emily, assuming I can hear you. [laughter] >> Can you hear me up? No, I can't. And it's okay. Uh, actually, it's not okay because I feel like I'm I'm, you know, I'm getting FOMO here, you know, like what is she saying? It's got to be awesome. Uh, [laughter] but, uh, but, you know, for for you as well, like like what sort of tools are you using in your work to help surface some some awareness about about what could potentially go wrong? >> Yeah. So, this must be really strange for you not being able to hear me. Um, but yeah, I think to Michelle's point, I want to start by saying maybe more on the slightly pessimistic side of tooling. I think generally AI is obviously built on a lot of systemic bias and things like that already and we need to be really really critical with how we are using tools. So, for example, I saw an AI health bot a little while ago that people could say what their symptoms were and then it would advise them to go to phone the doctor or whatever. And for a man, it told them that they were having a heart attack. And for a woman, it said they were having a pan panic attack and basically just to sit down and have a cup of tea. And I think that that is really really quite worrying when we are in you know more and more businesses particularly businesses that are like venturebacked um by investors are wanting more AI adoption inside the tooling themselves. So I think that the one of the first things that we can do is think really really critically about how we can use these tools in our day-to-day process. Whether that's in our products and services themselves and embedding them or whether that's a tool that we are relying them as as sense checking. I think that there are a few tools that I'm starting to explore. One is a little bit controversial and it is along the lines of synthetic users. Um, I think that it can be helpful if it's fed off of your own data and can help people be honest with actually these are some of the scenarios that have come up in the past and can make people think um whether it's PMS or us as designers or researchers around we know this is true and it can help you to really surface some of those insights. So that is something I've been exploring to see how helpful or or unhelpful is it in my process. Um, one thing I've been trying to do is the concept of evals. Now, that's getting more in the PM space a bit more, but it's really trying to set guidelines around the AI of what should you be testing against? What are these different scenarios? So, you can put more guidelines in to say absolutely go and test it against this, this, this. So, you've got more confidence that it is working within your guard rails. Um but one thing that has actually surprised me is just using things like chat GPT claude and whatnot is when I put in lots of parameters like lenses or different scenarios you can go and I almost brainstorm with it a little bit and say is there a scenario here that I haven't considered and there has been times where it has actually surfaced things to me that I haven't thought about before. So I think that actually like it can be helpful. We just need to think really really critically about how and where we use AI in our process. I'm done. [laughter] >> Thanks. Yeah, you know, I' I've I've people give me helpful tips, you know, to go to go t the captions. I just haven't been been able to access them, unfortunately. Um I know I know it's it's a bummer, but you know, hey, what could go go wrong in an in an event like this, right? Um anyway, [clears throat] I just have one other uh question before we we wrap up here. You know, like a lot of what we're talking about here, you know, I know that we came under the the umbrella of like easy accessibility, but we know that there's still work involved in this and there's real human work that goes into it. Um obviously, you know, we've all probably been u been been challenged with the argument that like, hey, we have time, we have budget constraints. um how do we how do we you know make u make headway in with with stakeholders who might be you know concerned that this takes too much effort or too much investment. Um Marcel I want to start with you as someone you know who's you know who you know who has a product who can surface these things quite quickly. Yeah, I think um especially with regards to stakeholders, it's a way about how to communicate the value of accessibility and also the awareness for the topic of accessibility and also not like with our example with the lawsuit and actual deadlines that it should be a continuous task um that you should in infuse in your organizational culture in the daily workflows and actually um it has always been like I'm coming from UX X design from design systems um it always have been part of a good qualitative um design and implementation workflow. So if you are following standards, if you doing a UX design practices, if you include users, diverse users uh in your development of workflow, then accessibility in general is not really much more effort in our um experience than like if you have a really low quality starting point and you have a project you have to be compliant within the next weeks, then it's like really really challenging and um maybe also too complex for for the people to actually apply it and they afraid of it. They won't um do anything about it and kind of block accessibility from from their daily work. that would rather go for building a culture of continuous awareness and infusing into a good practice of design and actually coding. Maybe we we have to start learning again how to actually do this um in the creation process and then accessibility has always been a part of it by default. Yeah, you probably had the best, you know, case for for for improving things that, you know, at all. Like, hey, we're getting sued, you know, [laughter] like like, geez, that just, you know, it seems like, you know, like, do we want to keep this, you know, uh, happening and, you know, that's, you know, clearly a business case that could be that could be avoided up front. But in in the absence of you know a very clear right in front of of you lawsuit Michelle like like what what sort of ways can we you know push back against the you know time and budget constraints? >> Yeah I like how you said push back. This is part of the reason I became a consultant [laughter] so I'm not like in the environment I can come in and like bulldoze. Um it starts though with um making your stance very clear that this is not a compromise. Um so one of the things I've I've often said when people say this takes more time. No. Uh time is based on intent. So what you're saying is you didn't intend to do it so it's going to take more time. Otherwise it wouldn't take more time. It would just take time. So I think we could also just start having reframing conversations like this project is going to take this amount of time to include these different things we need to do for accessibility and just stay consistent with that so that again we're not framing it as this extra thing. It's just the thing we're doing and we're accounting for it accordingly. >> Thank you. And I get guess what I actually got into the captions now. So, so, so I should be be able to at least follow along with with Emily [laughter] for some reason. I don't know what what that bug is. It's, you know, it's probably one of those things on my end I have to like refresh or something. Um, but anyway, Emily, I'd love to know how how how you would suggest pushing back against a u, you know, a culture that that, you know, that seems to prioritize, you know, time and and budget constraints. >> Yeah. So, I think that I've definitely not had ideal scenarios. I've worked in startups where time is money and you just have to ship it and build build and working in gambling where to be honest you are actively like fighting against the business and um I can't don't have enough time to talk about it right now but that was one of the most important jobs I ever did was being able to advocate for the business in uh for the user in that environment and I think that one of the things is that I learned really really quickly is you have to be okay with being the person that goes against the grain. And not everybody is going to agree with what you say. Not everybody is going to yeah like what you say or what you have to say. But you h like I said before we have a responsibility to be the ones to raise that because the people using our products and services can't be in the room themselves. So we have to advocate for them. So I think the the best thing that I found is not to take it personally. If people are pushing back, it's not because it's anything against you and trying to understand why are they pushing back. And as Michelle said, it's not because it's going to take more time. It's not going to cost you a lot more money. This is how we can actually get there. Um but yeah, from a personal perspective, try and separate yourself from what the person is saying to what you're trying to say. Um is the biggest piece of advice I' I'd give. >> Thank you. in and and and I could actually follow along with that in the captions which was really cool. [laughter] >> Great. >> Yeah. You know, like I think there too um uh see you were saying something in there about about being the you know being okay being the person who goes against the grain. And I think that that takes a lot of courage. I think that's the reason a lot of folks get into accessibility consultancy or advocacy in the first place, right? because we want to get people to care. And sometimes that can be a frustrating endeavor, right? Because we can't force someone, you know, to to actually, you know, take on something as as important to them. Um, you know, that's not something we can force people to do. So, uh, you know, so it's like knowing that like that like, hey, we have to, uh, you know, to sometimes go against the grain of what people believe and what they say and continue to be a consistent advocate for those things is really worthwhile and and like like a good reminder to fight the good fight there because it can be exhausting, right? >> It can it can be exhausting, particularly if you feel like you're the one in the business that's constantly saying no. Like it it's it's hard and and it can get to you. But I think that as much as we obviously we try and understand the the people that we're designing for us, our users is I really really try and understand who I'm who my stakeholders are in terms of what's their fears and what's their pains and how can I actually help them like kind of in the way that I would like them to go kind of thing. Um, and really, yeah, just because there's quite often a worry behind there that you can help to address and say, \"Okay, actually, you're telling me this, but the root cause is this. So, I'm going to alleviate that for you, and this is this is how I'm going to do that.\" >> I I love that you mentioned that that, you know, even stakeholders have fears there, right? Sometimes it's just knowing or like having that awareness as well and seeing what the uh what the bridge be between, you know, our fears and their fears are um to make sure that there's that there's alignment in them. Because if we're just making the same argument over and over, it could just be like talking to a brick wall, right? You know, we're making the same case over and over, but it's not sticking. And it's because there's a certain fear driving um that that that lack of understanding. um all three of you like you're just all such great people and the fact that that like you have you know such expertise in this area is well I'm just going to use the word delightful. [laughter] Um, I really think it is and just really appreciate each one of you taking the time to not just come come up here and spend time with us, but to also uh, you know, share your expertise with with us because um, we all have areas to improve uh, when it comes to uh, to accessible practices. Um, I want to bring Jiren up on the stage because, you know, he always does a good job of these, you know, little house house cleaning tips at the very end or housekeeping tips, I should say. Not house cleaning. You don't clean things very well, Jiren. And you know, I've seen your your your rooms before. They're pretty messy. >> I I always thought like I keep my room super clean. You can look behind me. It's fantastic. >> You know, there's something just just like weird with with my audio, I guess, because now I can't hear can't hear you. So, it's like I can only hear Michelle and Marcel [laughter] the whole bunch. So, I'm just gonna go dark here and just say thanks. >> It's It's all right. I I'll let you take over. >> I'll I'll take over from you here. First first of all, thank thank you Jeff and thanks uh Michelle, Marcel, and Emily for amazing presentations and I was I was glued to my screen and not only because you couldn't hear it uh Jeff, but I was actually glued to my screen. Um I I I just want to do a little bit of a little bit of housekeeping. Um because first of all I want to make sure that people know that you know they can start buying Michelle's book. Yay. It's live Michelle. Well done. Um so the uh the ebooks out the the print book's going to come later. Um anyone who is already a Smashing member can uh can download the book already because if you're a Smashing member you get all the ebooks for free. Uh for other people pricing is really really nice. Um so uh check it out. Um then we have three um conferences coming next year. Amsterdam, Fryberg and Antworp. Um we have just confirmed Emily is speaking with us again. Yay. So we're going to see Emily uh back with us. Um so check out our conferences. Um obviously we're doing a lot of online workshops. Uh quite a few planned in the next couple of weeks. is something for everyone, including those of you who want to do some accessibility uh work. Um, and then last but not least, uh, check out membership because you know, membership gives you all the ebooks we have, lots of discounts, so you make your money back really, really quickly. Um, and finally, I want to thank Marcel and his team for uh, for being our sponsor. Um, because this is really, really nice and actually really really enjoyed your presentation. Um so it was really quite eye opening to see how you do what you do and uh and and kind of the the challenges you have. So thanks very much for that. Um having kind of said that then I want to thank the audience for being with us. Um and then um we'll see each other in the next year um with um either other meet events like this workshops or um or conferences. So, um, hope to see you around and enjoy the rest of your evening.",
