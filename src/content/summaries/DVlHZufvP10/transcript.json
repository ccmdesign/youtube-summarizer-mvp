  "fullText": "Hello guys, recently Cloud Code released a front-end design plug-in as part of their plug-in marketplace and this is how you install it and I decided to try it out. I'm not a front-end designer. I'm not a designer at all. I'm a back-end developer. So, for someone to help me with designs, that would be great. And AIS are in general quite good to generate front- end code and design. But let's see how cloud code specifically this plugin and this skill make it even better or not. I compared without the plugin and with the plugin in the same cloud code. So I tested it with a task of improving this homepage of default Laravel framework after installation. And this was my prompt. I've made a screenshot. So in this video I will show a few screenshots to zoom in the prompt so you would see it more clearly improve the design and make it more like a landing page with Tailwind. And in this case, I didn't use any design skill or any plugins and the result of that. So here's the before and here's the after. So it looks much more like a landing page. We can scroll down and see the features of Laravel, see the links. Basically same or similar things just like a proper SAS landing page. Looks pretty good. But then I installed the plugin and this is how you do that. Here's the screenshot and again a few screenshots because I already executed that on my terminal. So I cannot really easily scroll up after many prompts. So yeah, plug-in marketplace there's official marketplace from cloud code from entropic and then from that marketplace you choose any plug-in you want and this is the command for plug-in install specifically front-end design from that cloud code plugins marketplace. Cloud code has a system to add additional marketplaces with skills and plugins, not necessarily first party, but this case is front- end design from Enthropic themselves. And you just hit install and that's it. The trick though, what I didn't realize, I needed to restart cloud code because I tried to execute the same prompt and it made another design version, but then when I asked if you use the front-end design skill, cloud code told me I don't have any skills installed. So, it didn't pick the skill right away. Not sure if it was because I had to restart Cloud Code or some other reasons. I will now show you version two without the plugin. So here's version one without the plugin and here's version two without the plugin with the same prompt. Almost identical. So version one, version two, version one, version two. We can also scroll down. Also good. Looks fine. Pretty similar elements just in a bit different positions. But now it also added a code snippet which was not present in version one. But I'm happy with either of those. And then when I restarted claude code and prompted specifically like this use the front end design skill or in fact I see I made a typo but it still recognized that. This is kind of cool but anyway it proceeded with the prompt and then it specifically asked me to use that skill. So if it activates the skill according to your prompt there's no official kind of way to trigger the skill. You need to put that in the prompt somewhere similar how MCP is recognized to be called and then you approve that to proceed with the skill and let me show you the result. So again the original version the version one and then in V2 if we launch V3 here this is version three with the skill of frontend design. If we scroll down we see similar things but with a few kind of key differences I would say. First the fonts like compare these fonts to that one. Second we have this block which didn't appear in the first versions. Not sure maybe it's random but still this appear only with the skill and also the effect. So when the pages were loaded see that dynamic loading it wasn't present in v1 or v2. And actually we can take a look what's inside of that plug-in that skill and what clot code actually adds to the prompt. If I understand correctly, this is exactly the skill as markdown and this is what's inside design thinking purpose tone critical. So probably under visually striking and memorable it means those dynamic parts that jumps on the page also rules around typography, colors and other things. Also interesting a few never things. Never use generic overused font families. Cliche color schemes particularly purple gradients and also never converge on common choices space grotesque. As I'm not a designer, I don't even know what that means. But basically a few rules around never probably meaning that the default AI and default claw models would often do purple gradients and I approve they do. So yeah, not sure. Do you actually like that version three better than V1 or V2? Personally, I prefer actually V2 here because the code is more readable and also I like the code snippet here and this V3 font looks less readable to me personally. But maybe it's just personal preference. We can discuss in the comments below. Have you tried that front-end design plug-in by Cloud Code or other tools to improve the front-end design and visual presentation of websites? Let's discuss in the comments below. And I will continue trying out various tools on this channel. Latest newsletter issue. I even renamed it to I will try AI coding tools so you don't have to. And this is kind of my new mission on this channel and in weekly newsletter. So this is the issue I sent just earlier today. Still news from industry around AI coding. But I will make more videos with the style of I tried something so you don't have to. But of course, this is only my experiments and we can discuss in the comments what have you tried and did it work better or worse for you. But if you want my weekly summaries here every Wednesday, subscribe to the newsletter. The link will be in the description below. That's it for this time and see you guys in other",
