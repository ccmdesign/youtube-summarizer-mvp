title: Arvid Kahl’s SaaS is 98% Coded by Claude
description: >-
  Trying something new on the channel!  This is episode #1 of a new series
  called 'Builder Stories' where I'm inviting fellow builders to show us how
  they build and tell the story of their transition to adopting AI.


  This first episode features Arvid Kahl, a SaaS founder of
  https://podscan.fm.  Arvid shows us his entire setup and how he actually uses
  Claude Code to build and deploy 98%+ of the code for every new feature he
  ships.


  Please bear with me on the video quality issues (still working out the kinks
  in my interview format!).  Upcoming episodes are better :)
