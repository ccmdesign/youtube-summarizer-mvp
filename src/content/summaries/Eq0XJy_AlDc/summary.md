  title: "Arvid Kahl’s SaaS is 98% Coded by Claude"
  description: "Trying something new on the channel!  This is episode #1 of a new series called 'Builder Stories' where I'm inviting fellow builders to show us how they build and tell the story of their transition to adopting AI.


    This first episode features Arvid Kahl, a SaaS founder of https://podscan.fm.  Arvid shows us his entire setup and how he actually uses Claude Code to build and deploy 98%+ of the code for every new feature he ships.


    Please bear with me on the video quality issues (still working out the kinks in my interview format!).  Upcoming episodes are better :)\

## Key Takeaways

Arvid Kahl shares his workflow for maintaining a complex SaaS product where nearly all code is generated by **Claude Code** and managed through a high-context system.

* **Systematized Prompting**: Using files like `claw.md` and the **Oxto** library ensures the AI follows a structured plan-implement-verify cycle rather than guessing.

* **Video-to-Docs Pipeline**: Narrating screen walkthroughs and converting transcripts into markdown allows the AI to understand **UI relationships** and business logic that raw code alone lacks.

* **Managing Comprehension Debt**: Developers must review AI changes to maintain a **unified theory** of the codebase, preventing the human creator from becoming disconnected from their own software.

* **Automated Testing**: Leveraging AI to write thousands of tests (3,500+ assertions) provides the stability needed for a 98% AI-written application.

## Summary

### The AI-First Development Stack
Arvid Kahl reveals how his podcast monitoring platform, **Podscan**, is almost entirely coded by **Claude**. While his primary IDE is **PHP Storm**, he utilizes **Claude Code** as an agentic partner. A central piece of his infrastructure is the **claw.md** file, which uses the **Oxto/Augster** system prompt library. This provides a "normalized" framework for AI behavior, forcing the agent into a rigorous workflow of phased implementation and autonomous verification.

### Video Walkthroughs as Context
To solve the problem of AI not "seeing" the application, Arvid uses a **video-to-docs** workflow. He records himself walking through the app, narrating every button click and UI state as if onboarding a human employee. He then feeds the transcript to Claude to create comprehensive **Platform Documentation**. This documentation allows the AI to understand the global context of the product, ensuring that new features fit cohesively into the existing UI and logic.

### Combatting Comprehension Debt
Arvid introduces the concept of **Comprehension Debt**, a form of technical debt where the developer’s mental model of the code drifts away from the actual implementation. Because an AI agent builds a temporary "theory" of the code to solve a task and then discards it, the human must re-synchronize by reviewing every diff. Arvid uses **Git

Hub Copilot** to step through changes, ensuring he maintains a "unified theory" of the product. This review process is what allows him to maintain a codebase he didn't technically write.

### The Philosophy of Non-Interference
Arvid argues that developers should avoid manual "hand-touching" of code during an agentic session. He treats the AI like a delegated developer, noting that manual edits can destroy the **internal integrity** of the agent's current task representation. Instead of manually fixing a small CSS error, he asks the AI to fix it. This ensures that the AI, which has a temporary but comprehensive view of all file dependencies, updates every instance of a variable or style across the entire application simultaneously.

## Context

This video marks a significant shift in the 'Indie Hacker' landscape from manual coding to system orchestration. As AI agents like Claude Code become more capable, the primary skill for founders shifts from syntax proficiency to context management. Arvid Kahl’s approach demonstrates how a solo founder can maintain an enterprise-level codebase—complete with thousands of automated tests and complex backend queues—by acting as a high-level manager. This is highly relevant for software engineers and entrepreneurs looking to scale their output without expanding their team, highlighting 'comprehension debt' as a critical new challenge in the AI-assisted era.
