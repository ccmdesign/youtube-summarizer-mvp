description: >-
  Bitchat uses low energy Bluetooth mesh networking to send messages when wifi
  and cell are down. Free, encrypted, made by the guy who created Twitter.

  The more people who have this app, the better it works. Worth having installed
  for emergencies, natural disasters, or travel... More relevant than ever.
