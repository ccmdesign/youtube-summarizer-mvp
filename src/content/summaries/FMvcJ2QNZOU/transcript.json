  "fullText": "Yo, not to be alarmist, but I've been thinking about this a lot and I genuinely think that everybody should download this app called Bit Chat. It lets you chat with others when there's no internet over Bluetooth using a mesh network. So, look at this as a emergency messaging system that you could use to connect with your friends or your loved ones when the internet goes out. This is not a paid ad. The app is completely free. It was founded by the creator of Twitter, Jack Dorsey. It's completely open source and the point of it is to create a secure, private, encrypted way to communicate when the internet goes out. And with everything going on in the world right now, I think it's more relevant than ever. Last week, we had a mysterious Verizon outage where WhatsApp and iMessage and email didn't work. There are natural disasters that knock out power lines and connectivity. And there's authoritarian governments around the world that are cutting off internet access to their citizens. Bit chat is not a regular messaging app. Not in the traditional sense. It's not real time. You have to be nearby somebody else that has the app installed and then they have to pass by someone else with the app installed for your message to go through. It's a mesh network, so the more people that have it, the better. So, your message will hop phone to phone until it reaches the person you sent it to. It's anonymous and it's encrypted and it has picture and voice note support. So, again, the more people that have it, the better it will work. And with everything going on, I think now is the time to get it. Something that everyone across the spectrum could agree with is that we're seeing authoritarian governments get more and more bold across the world. Laws, constitutions, and long-standing norms are being bent and twisted in ways we never thought we'd see. And it's happening everywhere. After watching what's happening in Iran and other countries, it's hard to think that shutting down the internet to silence the people will not become common practice, even in places you wouldn't expect. So, my advice is simple. Download the app, keep it on your phone, you don't even have to set it up. Worst case scenario, you'll never have to use it. Best case scenario, if the internet goes out for whatever reason, you have a way to communicate with your friends or family if they also have the app. It's just a good tool to have in your toolbox.
