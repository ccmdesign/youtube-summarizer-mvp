  "fullText": "My life. Okay, that's good. And hello hello wonderful people joining us today. So here we go. This oh I can hear myself twice. So I better mute myself over here. So welcome everyone. Fantastic to have you. So many people have joined. That's unbelievable. So welcome back everyone. We'll start in around maybe a minute or so uh from now. Oh, I see some familiar faces. Hello, Gillard. Wonderful to see you. You haven't changed. Oh, you're even fireworking all the way in. This is scary, I think, in some way. I think you must have been preparing for this for years. So, welcome back or welcome forward or just welcome everyone. Very excited to see you all here. Um, let's just maybe start with a little um there's a little timer over here so we all know when we started when you're going to rewatch this later. So maybe 30 seconds and then we'll start. Welcome in. Settle in everyone. And I think the gong has gone. So we probably should be starting. So hello and welcome everyone. Fantastic to see you all here. Uh welcome to also wonderful people joining us on YouTube as well. Uh I think that maybe a few more people will join us as well. We know how this usually works. First of all, could you please write in the chat just where you're connecting from? I'm uh very curious. Oh. Uh, sending you a lot of warm greetings, Louise. Uh, happy recovery soon. Um, oh, wow. Berlin, that's probably just around the corner right here. Uh, Nebraska, Latia, San Francisco. Incredible. So, welcome everyone. Well, this is a lot of countries. And when I look at YouTube as well, u this is probably going to kind of take a while until the comments will come in. Uh, so welcome in everyone. Fantastic to have you all here. There are very simple rules of the game. Now, first of all, I have to ask you, uh, can you write a plus in the chat if you're attending something like this with me for the very first time? Okay, a lot of first- timers. Could you write a star if you can find one? I'm sure Gilad can find one if you're attending not for the very first time. Okay, a few. Oh, wow. You have a lot of stars over here. Fantastic. Excellent indeed. So, there are very simple rules over here. First of all, the important rule is um you don't have to, you know, take notes all the time just to make sure that you actually have everything. Everything is here already. So, I'm going to drop in a link to the chat in here, which is where you will find a Google doc, and I'm going to drop it in in our YouTube channel as well. Uh this is where you will find everything. I'm not sure if uh Google will sustain uh so many visitors at the same time, but you will find a lot of links here. Obviously, I'm going to show a lot of examples and references that you can then use later. There are also tons of slides to be specific of things something like thousand plus slides. Uh but you can find them on Dropbox and on Google Drive because I know that some of you might be connecting from a place where you might not access Dropbox or Google Drive. So these are the two options. Then there are also some notes that I have added in around the design workflow and of course around the complexity navigation search autocomplete sorting and many many many others as well. So a lot of those examples that I'm going to show are already here. So you don't have to take screenshots although I do encourage you to just take notes because you might want to refine things later. Uh but you will find all these links over here already. Now this Google doc is not going to disappear magically I hope unless you delete stuff. So please don't delete stuff that would be very nice right also uh what you will find here at the bottom all the way down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down is more stuff like u stuff for AI enterprise design systems and a few others as well. Uh plus if you are not sick of me after one and a half hours of us doing this together there are two bonus points. Uh, one bonus is accessibility workshop which I recorded I think something like 4 months ago or so. Oh, we have material with guitar. Okay, I'm surprised. Let's see what happens next. Uh, and you will also find a search workshop. Both of them are 9 hours. So, if you have well hold on 7 hours. So, you have nothing else planned for today. Good luck. I wish you luck indeed. If you have any questions, obviously you will have time to ask questions here. So, I'm going to stay um probably like one and a half hours later after this, right? To make sure that I answer as many questions as I can. Uh but if you have other questions or if you want to work together, which could be fun too, uh please drop me an email and let's make it happen, too. Okay, enough of that. Also, everything is being recorded. So, if you're just jumping in or if you need to leave early, not a problem. Uh you'll receive a link from Maven uh where you will find recording and everything else as well. All right, this is sort of this stuff around the question that always comes up where to find this document. I try my best and apparently I didn't run enough visibility testing on this. This doc right here is the link to that file. It's smash.bby/maven26. I'm going to type it in the chat and also type it in YouTube. So, we all have that. With this, I think I wasted four minutes of your life. So let's better start and let's go all in because I have a strong assumption that you are here because you want to explore this magnificent world right well hopefully otherwise that would be a very sad investment of your time and effort right so what you will find over here right is Niss is writing that can't access the link so this should be working if not I'll make it accessible later right what you will find in the session today is something that I wish I'd known earlier now for the last like what 10 11 years I've been spending a lot of time working in very different organizations and companies and I think that if you are attending designing for complex UIs today probably you are working in some of them as well. So I was working with an accounting software. I was working on an insurance comp with an insurance company. I was working with a public service and still I was working on CPQ systems. I was working on B2B systems. And in not a lot of those environments, I realized very quickly that many things that I believed were true were not true in these sort of environments. Now the context with which I come to this is looking maybe very similar to this. Does anybody feel home in any of those environments? Anything feels like, oh, [sighs] that's me. That's me. I belong there. This is my world. Every single day, every single uh of my single of my life is this. Well, if you are in those environments, right, they actually have a lot in common somehow, right? When we look at all of this, we could say, well, healthcare, ehr systems, um, CRM applications, procurement software, banking, CFD products, enterprise resource planning products, analytical dashboards, and stuff like that. There's a lot of complexity in some way. If I ask you, do you feel like this stuff is easy? I don't think that anybody would ever say, well, this is a relatively straightforward field. I have nothing to do there. However, the complexity has a lot of sides and I want to really dive into this and leave you with a bunch of tools and techniques and patterns that you can apply right away. Again, mostly things that I wish I'd known earlier, right? And of course, when we look at this world, we can explore it from very different perspectives. One of them is this. Now, this does not look like a simple application that you would use daily. Although maybe some of you for some reason or another are using this daily. Hello everyone. My name is Vidy and I live in Berlin. I've been changing dentists uh just for fun. I don't know if this is something that you practice every now and again because it's extremely exciting to me to see just what kind of dentist application they would be using. This is remarkable. So Sam, we are in the same boat. This is incredible, right? And when you look at this, does it feel complex to you everyone? Well, the way to articulate here because we have like what 500 people 600 people here is by writing it in chat yes or no maybe right this to some well to Veronica it isn't well hopefully you're not working on this every single day Veronica but that depends indeed now when we look at this what I see here in front of me is not teeth well you did not see this coming coming in the first slide did you what I see here is data a lot of data actually and we have this data grouped and organized in one way or the other. We also have outliers that are marked in some way. We have data points a lot of them and of course you can drill down. Okay, this was supposed to be a joke. It was supposed to be funny. Sorry about that. You can drill down and actually explore one specific subset of data very carefully. You can edit data. You can change data. And of course you have something like you know those sort of profile settings and calendar because every single enterprise application needs a calendar. What's you know this is just not going to work otherwise. And then you have all of those other things like for example changing the view to look at the data, exporting the data, importing the data, dealing with the data, manipulating data in some way. It's all data. Now to me personally there is not much difference between this product and this product. It's almost the same thing just a very different domain and sure enough here we have way more tools we have way more you know basically different features that we could be using but in many ways uh it's data screaming at us that we need to manage now sometimes it's way more complicated than that some of you might be hopefully not working in this sort of environment welcome this is supposed to be a Halloween session but it isn't uh welcome to this world that you hopefully are not dealing with every day who is using something like this do you think who would be the main kind of persona for this right traders brokers banking indeed very often they'll be using something like this plus it's worth mentioning that this is one single screen but they will be looking at it from a very different perspective because they'll be having maybe a few of those screens at the same time right now if this does not look complex to you then I don't know what is right but very often this sort of environments there will be many different displays used at the same time. This is a very famous Bloomberg terminal setup and very often this Bloomberg terminal setup comes up with an environment like this where you have maybe four maybe five maybe six different screens and sometimes if you're going all overboard you will have eight screens. Well, nine actually plus because it's Blumbberg you probably want to have a dedicated keyboard for your actions. That keyboard that you see right here is looking like this. And of course, what you see here is quick actions to be able to activate certain things like governmental bonds, right? Or commodities or equities or anything like that. So this is very heavily connected to that Bloomberg terminal that you have. Now this of course is a different audience compared to what we maybe are used to, right? Because these are people who are experts in that domain. These are people who know what they're doing. Well, hopefully most of the time unless they lose a lot of money, right? And these are people who are basically already undergone some sort of trading training right to get to the point where they currently are. And this is actually very similar to any complex software that we're dealing with, right? This is a CFD product, right? Uh which is called Kolia I believe or not. We can basically simulate how particles are moving in different conditions. Now I'm just coming from a project like uh well one and a half months ago uh with a company that is organizing a power grid in Netherlands right and when you look at the products and the applications that are being used there they all look very daunting to us and when I come into a project like this first of all I want to cry and I want to leave as soon as I can right but then the problem there is that it takes me so much time to get anywhere I don't know if you feel like the same way as well right But if you are working on design of such an application right well you must understand the domain. So the people I was working with they were undergoing a particular training in physics as designers to make sense of the product that they're designing. Right? So what does that mean? I mean if you look at some of these projects if you were tasked to improve the efficiency of employees working on this how would you even approach this? This seems like an incredibly messy, complicated, and covert project, right? And I want us to really start feeling a bit more comfortable and a bit more confident after this session. Not because I have all the answers in the universe, of course not, right? But I want to kind of point out some things that were important for me to understand and to learn. So hopefully you can benefit from that as well, right? And of course, as you're writing, FJ is writing in core design, which would be very important. We need to bring these people in. I'd spend a week just watching them. That's the best thing you can do to being exposed to how they use a product, right? And so on. Um, but you really need to understand that domain as well. Now, if we abstract away, of course, there are many different sides of complexity, right? This is complex maybe to some of us. This is complex to some of us. This is complex to some of us. But even although it might look daunting, it doesn't mean that it's extremely difficult to manage for those people who understand what is in front of them. Right? So when I look at our topic today, what I try to think of is the environment. I want to see what is that environment where people who are using the sort of products will be. And I think that many of you might be in the same boat as well. These products, this complex product, whatever complexity that means, right? Because it's subjective, right? To some people who understand something like physics, a product that I was showing earlier might not necessarily look complex, right? But then when we look at these products right you by the way everybody does see the screen you see the okay excellent takes you a couple right so these products are inherently complex they are for domain experts very often there is no clear linear workflow where you can start and then you finish like in the form it's not quite like that there are also many points of entry there is a steep learning curve because it's designed for experts often these are products that have maybe just 5 10 15 users or maybe two users, right? Often these are also use products that people cannot choose. They if people do use them very often it's intense intense usage rates maybe eight or more hours a day and that's important because once you use something for eight or more hours then you get so familiar with it that you know it doesn't even make sense make a difference what it actually exactly looks like right those people also use custom presets and keyboard shortcuts. There are a lot of so-called zombie features and duplications. Zombie features are features that exist but nobody ever used them but they're still around because why not, right? Then what we also get is fragile systems, high stack situations and often very difficult environments like volatile, uncertain, ambiguous environments. And what we ultimately need to do as designers is to maximize clarity and minimize mistakes because this is an environment which we're designing for. Does this feel like home to you everyone? Well, before that I showed you just an overview of the different products. It does not matter what those products are. What matters is the environment in which we happen to be right now. Okay, I I see a bit of uh support here. VUA is one of those mental models about how to think about those sort of situations. If you type it in on Google, there is basically a big overview of situations that you might want to deal with. Though this is situations which are complex, volatile, uncertain and ambiguous. This is where the abbreviation booker comes from, right? Okay. So, how do we then deal with it? Now, first of all, I think it's important for us to be understanding why things actually even look complex or kind of appear complex to us. And for this, I want to kind of really start zooming in and try to understand how people would use in a product like that. And in the end, you hear a lot about people speaking about managing cognitive load, right? Things are complicated. We need to make things easier so people can manage it easier. So we reduce the cognitive load here. And I was obsessed trying to understand what it actually means. If we look at something like this here, right? And I think about it, how can I measure cognitive load here? How can I understand if somebody is very happy with the product or very unhappy with the product? They're stressed with this product. If they're not stressed with this product, h it's very hard to say. very often. I think that one of the first ideas that we have is well we need to simplify and I think that this is the first thing that I learned that this is a really a big mistake because you cannot simplify complexity. You can simplify complexity by removing it but you cannot remove it and keep people effective or efficient with a product. There is this famous law the Tesla's law about conservation of complexity because complex systems always preserve their complexity. We can't remove it. It has to be dealt with. The question is how much burden we put on the user and how much on the system or the technology. What the hell does it mean? Well, that basically means that if you actually need a product that is matching complexity of the real world which can be messy, convoluted and chaotic and that people need to be able to manage, right? Then we can't just oversimplify because then it will not match the complexity of the world. The question then is how do we help people navigate that world, right? And very often we can do a lot with decent defaults, with decent presets, with decent reuse of some features, with different views and exports and things like that. So as long as we can put that burden on the technology while still making this complexity exposed to users at the same time when they need to have it exposed this was when we actually improving the product right and I really didn't understand it for a while until a friend came to me and said think about every product being like a city like what what do you mean well every product is very much like a very big city think about every complex product like New work. There is a lot of stuff happening. There are a lot of requirements. There is a big infrastructure. There are a lot of shortcuts, chaotic behaviors, things that are unpredictable, snowflake scenarios and stuff like that. The worst thing you can do is to simplify. The second worst thing is to do that you can do is to say, well, let's just make it more consistent. No, this is not what you want to do because this this whole environment often leaves from being incredibly incoherent. You can't enforce consistency in a world which is inconsistent. Then you just break that product for people who actually desperately need it. Right? So what you need to do then is to find a way to orchestrate people's ways of working around it. And then I still couldn't understand what they actually meant until they said, \"Well, if we look at something like this here, right?\" And we think about how people would use it. What would be a great way for you to kind of understand the the task and the thing that people are performing? Well, I would say, well, probably I want to understand what people are using here and what people are doing here, right? I need to ask questions as an writing. I need to see how people use a product. And that's usually indeed where the starting point would be. But no, he said every product is like a city, which means it has islands. If you think about the city where you're living, there is an area where you spend most of your time. That's probably home. That's probably your work space. That's probably maybe your favorite spaces, places where you pick up your children from kindergarten and stuff like that, right? Every product is like a city. Meaning that in every product you will have some flows, have some routines, you have something that people are using a lot. Could be features, could be workflows, could be presets, could be templates or anything like that. You just need to understand that if you want to improve the city, you need to improve the area where people are. Does it make sense everyone? Then it kind of made sense to me, right? But then how do you actually do that? Right? But this is something I still couldn't understand. Well, let's take a look at an example. If you think about this cognitive load that I was speaking before. Well, of course, we could say that, you know, people are of course don't want stress. They want to be able to make progress. But when we think about high cognitive load, well, we mean that we don't want people to feel overwhelmed by a product. In fact, people actually very very good at finding shortcuts. They avoid things they don't like because of the islands, right? They avoid things they don't understand. They avoid things that are hard to use and they kind of find shortcuts to make things work for them even in a badly designed product. And especially, of course, they will avoid things if they're overwhelmed by a product. However, we must say at this point that it heavily depends on expertise, what people are used to, people expecting from other products and so on and so forth. Now there is this wonderful poster by the way about UX myths and if you Google it you will find it as well which kind of lists a lot of things which are kind of UX myth which are not true like that people don't scroll that people can't make optimal choice or people always make optimal choices and so on and so forth and in many ways this is also fitting the bill as well because I think a lot of things and a lot of rules that we are thinking of just don't necessarily fit in in general but also in the world of enterprise and and complex products, right? So looking back then again, people are very very good at kind of finding their ways and shortcuts, right? But the question then is when do we need to make a change and what kind of change do we need to make? Well, at some point if somebody's using a product for a long time, they stop noticing the UI entirely. I think I had too much coffee today, so sorry if I'm a bit abrupt, right? It's just becomes a matter of efficiency and resilience. So if people can be efficient and resilient with the product then they can they will use the fashion uh they will rely on it and they will have no problems using it. Let's take a look at an example. Remember this thing that I was showing before. How would you even go around designing it? So I want to show you this case study. This is not a project that I was working on. This is a project from an incredible design agency called Creative U Navy uh from London and I was really really impressed by what they're doing in so what is this? This is a product that's called Gexcon. I don't know if anybody is familiar with it or something like this but this is a 3D simulation software. It is used by engineers to model fires and explosions. These uh engineers are called CFD engineers or safety analysts or process engineers. as they discovered in this 3D simulation software that exists now for 15 years there is 1,500 or something of highly interdependent parameters right to define I mean I'm obviously not an expert in that domain to define any kind of parameters for simulate fires and explosions and when they started working on this what they realized and what came from stakeholders that actually there are two levels of complexity there's essential complexity and accidental complexity Can you guess what that means? What could that be? What does essential complexity mean? What does accidental complexity mean? This is something that you will hear quite a bit in in similar environments as well. Going to leave you just maybe five sec like 15 seconds to answer. uh MVP features very good Alexander accounting for past architecture decisions signal versus noise could be but it's actually think they're thinking about it differently essential is something that you should not remove it's an important complexity this is complexity that reflects the scientific logic that is required for accuracy of that product it is really critical right but there is accidental complexity which came along as a result of poor for legacy design over 15 years. It's just something that accumulated as UX debt over time. This is when people accidentally make mistakes. This when people accidentally don't find what they need and so on so forth, right? So essential complexity very important cannot be removed, should not be removed, right? And accidental complexity something we absolutely need to reduce or minimize. They had three goals. modernize a legacy system, support high-speed expert workflows in that product, and create a clearer learning path for new engineers. Now, fortunately, you could say, \"Well, but it looks great, right?\" Well, that's not quite what it looked like. Uh, well, get ready. Buckle up. This is what it looked like when they started. Does it look better? Nicer. Romano is like, \"It's okay. It's okay. I've seen worse. I think Bobb's not impressed. That's okay, Bobby. We'll get through. Right. So, what was the journey there? Well, the journey was well, let's figure out what we hell we're going to do here. Now, typically would think about it as a simple process. We do research. We evaluate options. We do all the double diamond. But you will never get the chance to do proper double diamond at this world. Right here, you need to kind of jump in, understand the domain first. This is a different world. And so what you have here and what they started with is domain learning right in any complex environment you need to start feeling comfortable. Uh I've been in situations where I haven't been feeling comfortable for one and a half years maybe two years and only then I actually started getting a sense about what is actually that we're doing here. So they studied everything they could, the fundamentals of the domain, the manuals, the dogs, the internal training videos. They did some control tests in the environment. They studied workflows and edge conditions. They trusted studied so-called trusted methods of operations, some workflows that should never be changed because they kind of need to really match physics, right? They interviewed people and they conducted those interviews with 24 users and and that's important and I wish I actually thought about it earlier because I just didn't do it. They conducted 23 working observations literally observing people using that product for their work spending time with that with their end users right they also conducted nine sessions with stakeholders PMs and developers to understand the logic the complexity and stuff like that and for some things especially related to legacy they had to reverse engineer the workflow sequence right and as a result they created something like this from each testing right this is a tester This is a power user 13 years of experience and they ran them through some of the most common tasks that they were performing and asked them to rank how they kind of uh perceived that task for them, the bucks that they reported and anything else that they might be kind of exploring there as well. Right? One significant part that probably is very common to you as well is that sometimes and this is where complexity for us leaves. We have a lot of nonlinear workflows which means people just jump in somewhere. You can't just say well people are going in a very predictable kind of sequence of actions. Well not quite. Sometimes they would be starting in the same place but sometimes they would start also at very different places. And very often they will be conducting the same sequence of actions but in a very different order and also sometimes at different speeds and of course also with different expectations what's going to happen. So to make sense of it they did one thing that I now do all the time which is task analysis. Has anybody heard of task analysis before? Yeah, this is probably like a kind of bread and butter of what we're doing in these sort of environments, right? But in this case identified 102 individual tasks and then they tried to understand the goals in each tasks task how often this task occurred the level of difficult difficulty and actions taken to complete them. Don't worry by the way I will jump into design patterns a little bit later today as well. I just want to really understand and get us kind of get a feeling about how we would deal with something like this. So they then ended up creating this sort of overview right where you have behavior frequency desired outcome as user set it complexity patterns that emerged in behavior and the overall user needs over here as well right so you have import scenario set simulation type run leak wizard and things like that right however sometimes they had multi-step task they had to identify the hierarchy of needs there as well and after that they converted it into a set of requirements for components and for flows including purpose, constraints, dependencies and expected behavior, right? And this was the first iteration that they actually had, right? This is iteration one. And if you look at this, well, we probably wouldn't understand what it is. We spent like what 5 minutes on it, right? Have variables and we have appearance here and we have a few views over here with different variables that we can control, right? And then from here on they were exploring other areas as well because if you look at it obviously you need to be able to prioritize what matters and dep prioritize what doesn't matter right and so when we look at for example data fields over here should it look like this should it look like this kind of should we show everything collapsed with enable people to navigate in between or should we actually keep it like that in separate views over here separate panes and then I kept going and it kept going and they kept going and it kept going. And of course, as you see here, to us, it looks like, oh my god, so much navigation, so many tabs, so many views, right? But this is pretty much the kind of the wireframe of what they actually ended up then creating. What we also have here is this tree or grid, well, data tree over here with different statuses also highlighted over here to indicate if it's something that requires attention or not. Now, along with it came of course a journey around different monitoring tools that they had to design as well, right? and specifically even looking into kind of further details. Oh my this is I I think this is really really important. What they had to understand is different situations and different states that we actually would have for different types of situations that you you have or mixtures that you have in in the simulation. Right? So they had these 16 different scenarios that they had to explicitly define together with the experts, right? to identify at which point and how they're going to visualize and highlight different things differently. Out of that came a design system. A design system for each of those states that you see all the way on the right, right? And this visualization over here, right? And the physics of it, right, is basically coming from that design system then as well. And so you have project outline advanced options over here. So and then you have this gas cloud for one of the few that you actually have here. And this is quite common, right? Because when we look at this, we have a global navigation over here. We have the secondary navigation related to whatever it is that's selected over here with all important tasks that have been prioritized in this journeys in the in the user sessions right here. Seems like a lot of links or a lot of buttons rather right that seem to work for them. And then for a level of whatever it is that you're actually presenting over here, right? They actually highlight this part which is basically the project where you can build it up as an engineer. And then for each of the selection, you actually have this navigation going from left to right. Very common. When it comes from kind of to navigation, we go from global to local from top to bottom. And when you change the level of detail, you go from broader level of detail to deep details from left to right. Right? Right? That's a very simple principle over here. Nothing super fancy at this point. But what was really important I mean when I look at this just remarkable amount of effort that was required for this they had to think about minimonics conventions for RGB colors because when people are looking at a model from different perspectives they need to understand which axis they operating on right and so what they had in the end they define these different colors for X Y and Z. And then when you're exploring a model, you need to be able to get a hint about from which perspective you're exploring it and what is happening where. Now obviously red and green is a color blindness issue. So that's not necessarily the choice that I would make, right? But they did remarkable job on this altogether creating this whole design system also around specifically those parts. Right? And this is how all of this came together. Now this is a very short overview. If you look at um at the links in Google doc, you will find a detailed case study on this which I found fascinating. But what I was really impressed is the outcome that they actually had as a result of that. Just basically following top task analysis. They reduced time to first successful simulation from 4 days to 6 hours on average. They reduced configuration errors per simulation from 5 to 8 to 1 to two. The reduced time to fix a mistake on average over a month that they were actually measuring it from 4 to 6 hours to 20 minutes and active use per team increased from 1 to 3 to four and then training on boarding was reduced to a bunch of short webinars and videos right so obviously it would be nicer to kind of convert it somehow into cash right as Jeremy's writing right uh to make a point about that but to me this brings a couple of takeaways right one key takeaway is I I think we can understand I mean they did it we shouldn't be underestimating it right altogether the whole project took what you know seven months for design execution six weeks for exploring UX options understanding gathering requirements and then four weeks for that research right so that makes 10 weeks plus 7 months that makes for around 9 months right that's manageable right but of course this part is the crucial part and this is The reason why I wanted to highlight it is because I think it just shows that if you actually spend time with people who are using the product, right? Um you can understand the situation which they happen to be and actually out of that define those tasks and then out of those tasks prioritize what needs to be in the UI, what isn't. Uh just to give you a sense about this um organization, they called Creative Navy. By the way, I can highly recommend their medium as well. Right over here they have a bunch of stuff about all kind of enterprise systems and enterprise products too which is really really fascinating to look at right so please do take a look and explore that as well and so what does it mean for me then I print I don't know sure on what the team size was uh to be perfectly honest when I look at this and think about it again coming back to this right every product is like a city we just need to understand in some way or another right what people actually doing in that city. And with that, I want to highlight some patterns which I think could be helpful to us to actually start feeling a bit more comfortable in this environment. Let me just jump in and move towards navigation and dashboards and tables and stuff like that. So, buckle up. Uh I think I hope there will be some useful notes in here as well. So well when we think about this sort of navigation right I think that a very common situation in which we find ourselves is thinking about hm what can we use we have a lot of different modes and all the different design patterns we could be using navigation bars mega menus accordians hamburger menu carousels you know footnotes side notes infinite scroll there are plenty of options now again this is a different world because this is one world which is quite complex This is another world which is quite complex right this requires very often very very different situations very different solutions but this is the third world which is again quite different too right if you're working on something like incar UI right well then the security is very important and so the way of how you design your navigation for example will differ significantly there as well this is designed for expert users so they need this sort of tooling as well so how do How do we improve that experience? Well, let's break it down and see what we can do. One thing that often comes up in the sort of environments of course is this notion of nesting, right? Nesting as we're used to it in very simple environments like this mega drop down navs, right? You go in in one of the sections and then another section shows up and then you of course go over the wrong boundary and then before you know it, you have to start all over again. This is a disaster in many applications and in many systems. That's something that we desperately want to avoid. Now, very often you will find people of course following it with a triangle pattern. You might have seen this before. So, if you have let's say um navigation and that navigation opens a content menu on the right, on the left, right? What you basically have is well, you draw a triangle. You draw a triangle connecting the point where your mouse pointer is with the boundaries of the content area. And as long as the user is navigating within it, right, then you kind of keep showing this content area, right? Sometimes, especially in our enterprise world, it will not be that easy because there you might need to be a bit more careful, right? For example, sometimes you will find situations where people are actually really crafting and building this little SVG path to cover just enough, right? To to make sure that people actually really looking forward or exploring these sort of sections or this subsection. Why would somebody go to extreme? Isn't triangle just easier? Just have it and then it's done. Well, you might have something else over here and over here and over there and over here as well because in our world we have a lot of density information density. So here we cannot just say well let's just just use triangle that depends on how much you're going to displayation by accident as well as Ken is writing. So we need to be more careful because ultimately this is the same problem that we have in context menus. Right? So that's what we want to avoid. I think that I'm crying every single time when I'm looking at this. This is not fair. Right? What we actually want is this. [sighs] So much better, right? So much better. So how do we do this? Well, we need to find a way to enable people to navigate that path right with a mouse uh precisely fast, right? And without making mistakes along the way. So, how do we do that? Well, if we look back at this example that I was showing with the SVG exit area path, this is the journey that they have taken to make it work in a simple menu. Very simple menu. Obviously, you will have different views of that, different configurations, different alignments and stuff like that, right? But it must be responsive, right? And so this must change depending on where you are from the top or from the bottom like whenever you're coming in from the left or from the right. So that must be quite flexible. That's not easy already. Then of course as you keep going and working through this we need to support right click probably and as you're navigating between the area where you tapped on it to open that menu you need to kind of make sure that it's also fluid. Right? Then as we keep going right very often what you also will end up is sometimes you will not have space on the left sometimes you will not have space on the right sometimes you will not have space at the bottom so you need to kind of accommodate for that as well but what if you have a lot of stuff right your context menu will need to move left and right and up and down in exactly the same way right we just need to make sure that you actually accommodate the space that is required to show it in full entirety Right? And then of course as you start using it, you need to support keyboard. When you're dealing with expert users, this is something that they will want to expect, right? So you need to be able to navigate by keyboard as well. And of course, if you have a lot of those sections, people need to be able to use keyboard to move for accessibility reasons, right? And then even further than that, if you have a lot of things going on at the same time, you'll have multiple levels of nesting stacked not vertically but horizontally and vertically at the same time. So it very quickly becomes uh kind of a fight against the windmill because depending on what the user maybe ended up creating or setting up or using it might become very daunting very very quickly. Right? So what do we do with that then? Well, first of all, again, this the reason and the way of how it's done most of the time is is with this triangle pattern or with this more delicate SVG path area which can be quite challenging to pull off, right? And I want to show you just one really incredible example that I discovered which is coming from post hog, right? I have this really nice little website which is a desktop view website in a way and I tried to break this navigation in some way. I'm going to drop in the link here in the chat and if somebody's watching this uh on YouTube could you please um type it in in the chat as well and so you can move between four to five to six level right and then eventually you might say well it must break well as you will see in just a second I think as you keep going here I really tried very hard but even if you're somewhere in between couple of section like you do you are here it does not break Right? That's actually quite impressive for me to see on its own. So this is kind of this implementation action that we absolutely will need. But we're just getting started because the other thing we absolutely need is a tree navigation. With tree navigation, we basically structure complex data into kind of organized levels and we need to make it accessible. Well, this is not always working because of course you can think about tree navigation looking like this. This is an archaeology data service from the UK and it has I think something like 1.3 million records or so. That's a tree structure that we have there on the left. Every time I look at this, I also have to cry at least a little bit. Do we understand why we have all these empty lines and how this exactly works with a radio button? Is it a radio button? I'm not sure. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. You never know. This is a mystery. um that mystery you might want to resolve if you go to ads website at some point right there's a lot of stuff happening over here right now this is a tree structure now this tree structure could be represented in different ways if you look at medical healthcare software right it might look something like this right uh not for main navigation but for content navigation this is coming from general electrics healthcare system and what you have here is a primary navigation on the top and then you have a content navigation which of course will be using this sort of structure right But if you have four, five, six levels, it will be almost impossible to pull off. It's really, really hard to pull off. Now, in the case of General Electric, what they ended up doing is creating a design system for this, looking into different types of those three structures like text label only, text label with secondary text, text label with an icon, and I really appreciate the effort to putting kind of making creating all those icons and also text label with icon and secondary text, which might be needed at times as well. However, of course, when we look at some of the things that they actually ended up creating, they were really, really careful about the icons that they were choosing. This was a huge I mean, if you're looking if you're working in a medical environment, I highly recommend you to look up the icon um system that they actually put together for all kind of diseases and all of that. It's incredible. Obviously, this does not necessarily represent kidneys, right? Uh neither does or this, right? So that's a bit of a yeah a no-go right but there's a whole structure around it right around the spacing around the right to left um interface there as well but the point here is and this is what I wanted to articulate here is that sometimes if you have let's say two levels right oh this is funny uh if you look at uh if you have two levels or three levels that works but you have four levels you need to do something else which would be called relationship filtering Some of you might have seen this before where you basically open the filter selection right or navigation area and you allow people to navigate from left to right rather than in a tree structure. In some way you can actually replicate the same thing by going from left to right here as well. Right? So basically if you have a lot of options this is probably the best way of the best thing that you can do. However, sometimes this is reserved for something else because you might have something like a multi-level app menu because if you're working on a product long enough, you will find that sometimes you reach a moment when the navigation is just challenged by too many things, too many features, too many options and it's hard to keep up with the pace of development here. This is a wonderful use case and case study from intercom uh which basically is redesigned now and it looks like this, right? So we have the global menu. We have the second level which is a second level navigation, right? And you can also pin it so you can see both at the same time, right? And then you have the third level. Then you have the fourth level all the way on the right. And you can also change the view as you can see at the bottom too. Now they had a problem. The problem was when people were looking at the primary navigation, they couldn't find what they are looking at because obviously the icons keep piling up and eventually this is a very common situation in a lot of products of a particular capacity, right? So they try to prioritize things, right? So things that are on the top are prioritized, things that are at the bottom are kind of not really prioritized, but people couldn't understand what they were, right? So they started in a similar way that Creative Navy did. I mapped out the flows of people, the needs, the hubs where they spend most of my time. Again, every complex product is like a city, but also the obstacles without breaking what's already working. So they started grouping using card sourcing and things like that to understand what people are how people perceive and understand um distinct sections on the site, right? And then they didn't want to simplify. The point was not to simplify but rather to see how the connections are perceived by end users. And so when they started kind of looking at it well practive support is proactive support. Context is context. That's nothing fancy here. But then if we look at something like let's say knowledge well people were considering knowledge as a part of it but also things like help center was considered to be knowledge right channels were perceived as settings but also intershop was perceived as settings so there were a lot of things that were actually flowing into kind of a common shared space and so they did want to simplify the structure but actually by restructuring it so by bringing similar things together creating new homes for old content, prioritize and dep prioritize of course and streamline key flows that people are using a lot, right? So this is what it came to be then. So because people perceived help center and knowledge as one thing, they just combined it into knowledge. So the help center would now live here. Not very surprising. They would also look into fini agent and automation people which people perceived as being AI and automation which they combined. And they ended up also just putting things together into settings that people perceived as settings right here while offloading other things here on the top. Right? So this is in the end the information architecture that they actually ended up creating. And this is the new navigation that they ended up creating. Now the one pattern that they use here was a little bit surprising to me because they actually use chevron and plus at the same time. Now do we understand the difference between them? Because they prompt different actions. Now, this is what I struggled with as well, right? Because when we look at plus, well, it could actually signify expansion, but it doesn't. It's adding a new person to that database, right? And this would be opening or collapsing that view. Well, as long as you know the tests are proving that it's working for the customers, that's the most important part. To me, it was not very obvious. So, this is what it was before. This is what it was after, right? We have basically very similar things on the top, although some things have changed. Like, we can have a long conversation about this later, but you see that right here, they were using my pronoun, my reports, my favorites, and so on. And they changed it to your reports and your favorites. Again, we can talk about that later. There's a whole article I wrote about this. Uh, it's it's a very long story, right? But then also other things here like hm so there is human support folder now there's automation folder now right there's proactive support as well and then instead of edit sidebar they have manage right so if you want to look at it uh if you just type in intercom redesign case study you will find it as well right uh I think it's quite fascinating in many different ways right however one thing I do want to mention here again this was the outcome that they actually ended up with All right. And of course, I went through a lot of different iterations on this. A menu that splits inbox in other parts and others as well, right? Uh so I don't want to just waste too much time on this, right? But one thing I would probably think of here and this is something that I learned from my experience that is usually it's a good idea to at least consider adding text labels to icons in that primary navigation. Even although you might think, well, this is not needed. People learn. Yes, people learn, but people also forget and that they need to relearn. Now, just think about how often do you actually need to hover over this icon, whatever it is that you're using maybe in your products to understand what is it actually again? Is it that one or is it that one? Now, there are only few universal icons, not many actually. And chances are high that very often these the icons that are used in your product will not be that universal. Right? For example, you think about creating and editing could be difficult. Saving and archiving could be difficult. And typically scanning 10 words could be actually faster than scanning 10 icons, especially icons that I find they're difficult to understand. So I would say when I would kind of rethink the navigation, I would think about maybe adding labels first and then removing them if we know that they're not needed. Right? So that might be kind of a better scenario as well. Right? So there is that. But also I think it's just one more thing on navigation that I wanted to highlight here. Oh my this is there's so much stuff uh on the that I have here [sighs] in the slides right but one thing that I wish I'd known earlier is this idea of navigation queries especially in those complex environments so please keep that in mind as well. The idea behind navigation queries is simple. We help people construct their own path towards where they want to be. Now, how does it work? Very simple. We basically really give people an option. This is the website of the city of Dudolf in Germany. And on it, you basically say, well, what do you want to do here? Well, I want to book an appointment for what? For a consultation. Boom. You give people directly the path to where they need to go. It's not replacing navigation. It's not replacing search. It's an additional way to help people navigate where they want to be. How do we do that? The same story as we heard before. We do task analysis and we try to understand what is the type of task that people are performing. It's a task based navigation as Vina is writing. And then we basically have drill down options. Maybe one section or maybe two drop downs, maybe three drop downs, maybe four. That's something that I was suggesting as I was working with European Parliament, right? We basically look at what do people want to do here and we broadcast or kind of make them front and center and then we drill down faster. that might work really well. If you look at something like ao.com, which is kind of a really nice example of this in action here, you go in and you start on the homepage and you're being asked four questions. Hey, what do you want to buy here? Right? And I want to buy maybe a washing machine. Okay. What kind? Uh front loader. Okay. How big? Uh big. Right? You define a pricing range. You have four most important filters defined right away within 9 seconds. Good luck doing the same when you're actually going through navigation and categories and search as well. This is remarkably fast. You'll find it in many other places too. Like for example, never. I'm a business and I'm looking for a group health coverage. Go. That's again a replacement for navigation. No, not replacement, sorry, but an extension of navigation which could be quite powerful too. Just whatever you do, please don't do this. This is coming from a wonderful coffee shop in Edinburgh in Edinburgh in E and Einhovven in Netherlands and you have four menus for free right for the cost of one if you like. You can open all of them like literally all of them. And when I saw this for the first time, I thought something is maybe wrong with me or with the world. I'm not quite sure. You can click on menu and then nothing happens. Can click on the hamburger and then you have your social media. You can have your primary navigation when you click on the menu and then you have a hamburger icon where you can open things as well. Sad times, very sad times. All right. Uh but moving along, right? What we also have of course is beyond navigation. Just you know maybe 20 25 minutes everyone. Uh please don't leave just yet. I have the best part in the end. Um I think we also need to think about the filters. So with filters is a separate story. I mean, uh, friends, I'm really so obsessed with those patterns somehow. I don't know how I got into this. But when you start looking around and you find some things that really work, you just I just want to share it with the world, right? This is just uh I I just wish more websites were actually better designed. This is sort of my passion behind it. So, when we think about filters now, kind of moving on from the world of navigation to filters, right? One thing that was very surprising to me is that very often when we think about filtering, search and sorting, they're perceived as the same thing. People don't perceive at as you know three different activities, right? Uh like I'm searching first and then I'm filtering and then I'm sorting. Now people are searching and filtering and sorting is kind of a part of it. So very often this kind of perceived as a single tasks task, right? However, very often people do search first, then they filter, and then they sort. Now, in our world, it could look like this, right? This is a tool that's called amplitude. Now, in amplitude, things are coming together, right? Because we have here global navigation on the top. Oh, sorry, behind the hamburg icon over here, right? Then we have the things that we can do within that section or whatever it is that you're working on over here with search as well. And then we have a kind of a local or more local view because again from right to left it's coming becoming more local or deep right so we have some navigation here as well between the different tools that they are providing to you right and then we have this little filters over here or selections I should rather say which basically influence the view on the right and of course as you walk through it and use it right you can also collapse that second level navigation or filters if you like right to make space for this Right. And it's kind of pretty much the same pattern everywhere. Thing at amplitude is one of the really few products which I find relatively complex for me to be able to manage frankly but actually really designed fairly well I would say right so from my end right and I'm happy to be proven otherwise right and so what we have here is again this global navigation second level and then we actually go in and actually have this content view over here. Now why does it matter? Well, it matters because when we actually think about how filters are perceived, of course, they very often indeed are on the left. However, right, when we look at the filters on the left, sometimes it can be just utterly broken. This is a famous and horrible, horrible, horrible example from Dell. Sorry about that, Dell. Um, which is just utterly broken. It's just everything that can be broken is broken here. Everything, right? So you just go in and you select a couple of things and then on everything is being cancelled except for the last selection that you have made. Um there is not very clear indicator why that happened. Then eventually it actually starts loading things and then you're fighting you're fighting against the windmill because as you go through the filters and typically it happens from top to bottom, right? As you click more it auto scrolls you all the way to the top. So you have to fight against it and go all the way back and then it forces you to go forward and then you actually want to go back and then at some point just something really strange happens because you not selected 14 in and you cannot select 15 in. This is it. It's not checkboxes. It's freaking radio buttons. That's not fair. This is an interface lying to me. That's not fair. I don't want this. Never. And then I keep going. Right. This is a wonderful example from Walgreens on the left where you have, hey, uh, let's select a couple of filters over here. And so you have all the sections. Great. Right. And we know how this works, right? And then, of course, you have the pop-up showing up because because why not? I mean, it only makes sense. And then whenever you select a particular filter, it exits the filtering overlay. So you have to reopen it and interact with it again, again, and again, and again. I've never seen a single person in the universe who would want to use exactly one filter at a time and exit an overlay and reopen that overlay to select more filters. People often select four, five, six, seven, maybe in an expert software 28 filters at a time. This is a disaster. This is just horrible. And then we said, \"No, we can do better. What if we blur?\" We like blurring, right? We open the menu with all these filters selected and then we have this blurring in the back and every time you select something you see the blur updating. Now that's fantastic. This is so helpful. I wish to see more blurring in my life. Right. And then crush field. Crushfield is a fun one. It does everything well pretty much. Well, most of it except for one single thing. Whenever I select a single checkbox, I don't get to see an update in any results at all. But it just h let's have a dance first. I don't want to have a dance. I want to see more results, right? And I want to see more filters selected. Well, you can see that I'm being a bit obsessed with this. Okay, moving on from here, right? What do we do with this then? Well, when we think about this filtering experience in general, there are a few things that we can do which are relatively straightforward. First thing we need to do is to decouple filters and results, right? Because again, people rarely select exactly one filter at a time. Typically, they select more filters per session, right? And blocking the UI every selection is not necessarily a good idea. So how can we do that? For example, like this. This is a Stockholm University website with filters on the left and results on the right. And you just click. Just click. Right. Just click. And the results are being updated as synchronously on the right. It never bothers you. It just there. and it's helpful and it's useful and it just works right plus also which I find actually quite funny it's not like links that you're being you're going to be link showing here you're actually displaying results immediately plus you can also filter the search results with search as well at the same time right so if you need to have filters on the left we need to at least decouple what we have on the left from what we actually displaying on the right but we also can actually display those filters above the search results which is usually a better idea so here what you and Galaxus and warm greetings to everybody who has been working on this website. It's fantastic e-commerce experience really although I never purchased anything but I always go for the shopping cart and check out just because I like it so much. I just don't live in Switzerland. Sorry. So basically what you have here is you're actually selecting what you want to select first. You choose what you want to do and then it's up to you to opt in if you want to apply it or not. And it's only when you actually select to apply it where it actually gets applied. That's kind of reasonable as well. Sometimes it can be a bit more complicated. This is a bigger uh library in Sweden. Sweden in Denmark I believe. And of course what you have here is filters. You can also customize results which is usually a very good idea for search in general. Right. Uh but then you also have um these options to actually do something a little bit different with the result that you see on the right. I'm going to pause here in a second. You will see it in a moment because some things might be a bit confusing. What does this mean? So, we see this icon on the right, the red icon maybe. Why would you want to use it? So, is saying unselect the rest. Ivan is saying exclude, uncheck, exclude from results. Yes, but at this point, some people might be confused. So if nothing is selected then I haven't selected any filter right if I click on checkbox then that filter will be applied but if I click on that icon it will be excluded but isn't it excluded already I mean if it's not included then I think in the history of the humankind it must be excluded Right. Well, the point is ah very good Ivan. It's not explicitly excluded. Right. Yes. But the point here is well this is a really great shortcut. It's a very useful shortcut because what you can do here is you can say I want maybe a few things that will be selected like open access and articles and stuff like that and everything else but not this. This is should not be a part of it. So maybe you want to have a lot of broader sections, right? or everything but not this and also not something else because if you want to exclude two areas or two filters or two attributes how would you do that? Well, you need to select everything else, right? Does that make sense? Right? So, in some scenarios, this could be very very helpful. It's just not very obvious about what exactly is happening here, right? However, one thing that I did want to emphasize here is that showing filters, applied filters above search results is very important. like this thing, this disaster that we actually have with Dell is broken for many different reasons and I can cry a long time going through this, right? But the problem is every time you select a filter that applied filter is appearing as a chip on the top on the left, right? However, because it always grows from top to bottom as you add more filters, it always changes the height of that box. So every time you keep going with your filters, you have to recalibrate your mouse because otherwise uh you will be hitting the wrong spot just because that area that filtering area on the left the sidebar on the left keeps growing every time you actually use it. Does it make sense? Right? So as you click here you cannot just click on the same spot. I mean not only are you being autoscrolled which is a disaster on its own. Right? So typically it's a better idea to actually keep those chips above search results rather than below them. Let me give you just a nice example of that in action. So for example, if we look at Yahoo, right? Yahoo has a screener. I mean you can have many different screeners, my friends. Some of you who attended some of my workshops will know that this is also a way to design uh a screener right now. If you ever experienced something like this before, I feel for you. If you haven't, actually I feel for you as well. This is the world of filters. Look at these filters. Mhm. This is like when when you come in in a product and say I need only one single UI component dropdown for everything because why not? And those drop downs are huge. I mean look at this. This brings back memories maybe to some of us right and then of course you could say well but what about pagenation? Good thinking good thinking. You're very creative. Let's go all in. Right? I mean why not? That's makes sense. So if you ever looking for you know more dropdowns in your life that would be a way right and of course you can say well you select filters gets applied select a filter gets applied select a filter gets applied there is a better way a better way would be something like this here now on Yahoo when you go into screener mode right you also get a filters but the way it works is very different so here you have this overview remember this like this side panel that I was showing earlier right here you have search if you're looking for let's say something like uh earning per share, right? So, here we go. Navigation. Boom. Boom. Boom. Navigation. Boom. Boom. Boom. Navigation. Boom. Boom. Boom. And done. However, the problem is that it doesn't update automatically. So, you need to actually apply every single time. That's a bit of an issue here because you don't even see it when you actually start navigating. So, it would be nice to be able to apply it all in batch, right? But you have this navigation between different sections, going to further subsections, and then going to specific filters. And you can also define the value for that as well. And this is how you actually construct your filters, right? So that's pretty cool. Plus on top of that, you also of course can adjust it from here and here, right? As well as here. And if you want to remove it all together, you can do that as well. Better. You can be creative with filters, right? I believe you can. So this is product chart. This is the world of full of surprises, I should say. So, if you look for a new monitor for your work space, how would you usually do it? Well, [sighs] you go to an e-commerce website. You go into category displays. Maybe you're looking out for the best displays in in the universe and stuff like that. No, you can do better like this, right? Look at that. I mean, why not? Oh, don't chat with AI. We don't chat with AI. We tell AI what to do at this point, right? So, here we go. We have the filters, the most important filters. You select what density is important to you and boom and boom and boom. Plus, if you care, right, you could say, well, let's do something very exciting, right? Like, for example, I don't know, we can map the screen size against the price. Wouldn't be more reasonable to, I don't know, choose inches per dollar. That seems like a good metric to have, right? And then, um, brightness. That's probably the weirdest thing you can ever have, but you can, right? Looks bright to me. Yeah. And then you can compare things side by side as well. That's again another way of kind of designing filters. I mean there are plenty of ways, right? So what do we take from this? Well, when we think about this and we actually do this, right? Again, I would say that a lot of times something like this relationship filtering can be very powerful. Well, I wish they supported projectors as well. Uh that's definitely true, right? Um, but sometimes you can do a little bit more like this is another view where you can actually put it all together where you can actually build up your own queries and filters. Sometimes it's actually much more meaningful to do this instead of actually giving people all the filters at once. Right? So there is that. But of course, actually when we start diving into this, there is a little bit more to this because one thing that I think is really important here, I just don't want you to be living without this is the notion about how we're going to deal in situations. Let me just jump in here. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just just a moment. Of course, I forgotten about it. In situations which would be a little bit different. Okay. Let me just show this example instead because I can't find it. So this is media marked. Media marked is an e-commerce um website in Germany. And what we have over here is a search box. We feel comfortable without a search box, right? I think search box is okay. We can do a search box. So if you're looking for something like HDMI, we have this view here. We have some product recommendations at the bottom and then we have this. Now, please write a plus in the chat if you know how clicking on this icon is different from clicking on this over here. Sorry about that. I accidentally accepted all cookies, Jessica, I promise. Okay, so some people do know, some people do not. Well, one thing that's quite obvious, if you Well, hold on, hold on. If you don't know what it does, what do you expect it to do right here? Open a new page. Open a new tab. Transport me to a location. Up a category. Open a tab. Well, not quite. Now, sure enough, when we actually click on here, well, then that search is being executed. That's what we were expecting. However, right, if you click over here, that's what happens. It brings text into the search box, right? It's a very useful pattern. It's an incredibly useful pattern that nobody understands, right? That's a bit of an issue with it because when you actually think about this, this is great because it actually helps people avoid your results pages. The problem with it though is right, if you actually want to use it and want to highlight it, right, well, you need to be quite careful about how exactly going to design it. So, um, let me just give you an example of that in action. Here I had it and now of course I lost it because I always get lost in here. Do I? No. Okay, I will need to double check and refine it in just a second. Hold on just a moment everyone. You see this is me uh doing things. Life is always hard. I think it was at least autocomplete. Autocomplete. Autocomplete. I my autocomplete section. I have it. And this is just what I wanted to show you. Ah, here we go. Here we go. Excellent. So, very often what would be a better idea to do is to actually add this little chips or wages or whatever you want to call them. So, now somebody is typing you distinguish visually between this keyword suggestions and searches that people are executing. Right? This is kind of a new design that Google has been rolling out. I'm not sure if it's everywhere now or not, but this seems to be now changing. Right? uh because of course this pattern that you have seen our media marked is actually coming from Android but again it's changing now so maybe it will look very different soon right so keep that in mind because once you're dealing with this this from my experience actually is really really badly understood but very very very helpful [sighs] okay the marathon is almost over just 15 more minutes everyone just in case you need to leave just don't forget that you actually have uh access to the video recording as well I will we will send it to you by ML by the way I forgotten I do have some training on Maven coming up so just in case you're interested uh I'm going in all in into AI um this will be fun and also on measuring UX as well so this would be also fun um feel free to explore there's also a friendly coupon that you could use as well but I don't want to waste your time so I'm just going to continue here the fun part get ready I'm trying to knock up your socks if I can tables right just 15 more Goodness everyone. Tables. Tables. Who doesn't like a good table, right? Well, the tables that we're dealing with are usually going to be quite challenging. Maybe like this. Maybe like this. Or maybe like this. These are not simple tables with two or three columns. They're probably going to look different. Maybe they will will look like this. Beauty. Beauty at its best. Now remember what I was mentioning before right when you think about the product right yes the second example is indeed a grid which is fantastic by the way um when you think about the cities right I think it's represent itself in many different environments too now if you look at some examples like this here this is an actual IT tracking study on fin which is a financial visualization tool what you have here is filters on the top and then the data table at the bottom can you guess what that person here is Now this sequence is numbered. So going from 1 to 60, right? And then the size of each blob represents the amount of attention people spend on it. So can you tell me what the user is trying to do here? Rachel, I'll get to a question in just a moment. Try to escape, says Arena. Hello Arena. Uh no, hopefully not. Find a specific data point to understand the effect of filtering. Sorting a column. Well, I don't know where one is. It's probably somewhere over here because there's two over here. Ah, very good. Omit is founded. Excellent. Moment trying to filter and then sort. Yes. So obviously there is a filter selected which is healthcare sector and then the table is being explored and then when we look at it exactly there is a lot of attention spent over here right and then a bit of attention on the data table right and what you also can maybe spot is that of course right here there's a lot of attention because that person is sorting by that table column right this is going from high to low so what I want to end I kind of emphasize at this point like in This particular journey for example and this is very common the person has never looked beyond the third row. They looked only at this column right at best and then jumped into page eight or something. Why on earth would you say you know what this is nice but I want to go to page eight. I belong to page eight. Why would you want to go to page eight? Is it because you you're looking for meaning in life on page eight or something? Or maybe it's like a indeed very good. Didn't think about it. This is funny. Yes, maybe this is like a number, right? So, this is a point where people are or a person is just lost and trying to guesstimate and jump to hope to get somewhere, right? But this is very random. Now, we might want to improve it. Now, if we look at a data table like this, how would we actually improve it? Well, this needs to I need to bring back this notion that I was actually trying to highlight earlier. So, please somebody remember that I'm right now on slide 638 because otherwise I will forget I believe. So, when we look at the navigation like I'm just going to type in 638 because otherwise I will be really forgetting it. Right. So, when we look back and see what we can do with that, well, there are a few things that are relatively easy to do or to pull off over here. One thing that would be quite helpful is to actually give people a little bit more control around where they're jumping like this. This is called steps pagenation, right? Where we could say, well, based on what somebody's sorting by, we could maybe surface that information, right, on a page dynamically or not, right? So they know where they're jumping. That might be helpful. So instead of just jumping to page eight, right, maybe they're sorted by a particular column, they could be we be surfacing that information over there. That's one thing. Another thing we could do is so-called scroll bar range interval where we could say h maybe we could highlight a little bit better where people are jumping. Like if you have let's say a list and you're sorting by something like let's say by pricing wouldn't it be helpful to I don't know have something like labels next to the scroll bar to indicate where a person is jumping. So when you click on 210 in you know infinite scroll or whatever you kind of know where you're jumping that might be helpful. You can also be doing it for pagenation in the same way as we saw. This by the way is a very famous well for me not for everyone it's a very famous screenshot I have taken of IKEA 2014 which probably should be turned into NFT so I could actually make millions u because this is the only time I saw this pattern in action the only time and then it was gone but I remember I'm like an elephant pagenation I never forget this is my life right and so this could be quite helpful in some way where we actually can help people navigate a little bit more predictable way, right? All right. So, good. But then what else can we do? Well, when we actually start thinking about what we else is possible when we're designing a table, well, we need to start from the beginning. And the beginning is trying to understand the architecture of the table, right? The table consists of guess what? Cells, rows, columns, and also interaction modes and commands and stuff like that, right? And so when it comes to cells, we have different content types, interaction, content, data quality, validate, invalid, error, message, input, hint, and so on so forth. Can be read only or editable and so on. We also can have different row interactions and actions. Move up, move down, normal, hover, selected, and so on. And of course, we can keep oop back, back, back, sorry. We can also go back, go down here, we have column, top bar, keyboard support, error, handing, and so on. We [snorts] just need to understand what exactly do we actually need, right? And once we do that, we need to think about what kind of interactions we actually need in a data table. So, let me just jump in and show you a couple of examples. This is my favorite example ever. This just fits so beautifully in the nightmare of examples I was showing before. I have to show it. This is a risk assessment tool. Anybody work in risk assessment? No. Not Roman. I'm feeling a bit happy. Sadly, oh my Ali, I'm very sad. Oh no, Ruba. Very, very sad to hear that. Well, this is what we get here. We have buildings across countries, in different cities, in different states with different addresses, property values, um, construction types, and also different rankings in terms of water supplies, sprinkle protection, just to make sure that things don't go bad, right? Also, oh my god, what the hell is this? We have this beautiful, eloquent, intricate triangles, friends. What do these triangles mean? Ah, very good, Gloria. Yes, this is order. This is multis sorting because you can sort by one column and then you can sort by another column because why not? I mean, very often it's actually very much needed and very helpful, right? And so triangle is a way to illustrate that. We are working with wonderful people like Dave. Dave is a loss prevention consultant and he basically works with policy holders to identify potential loss generators. So he's going to facilities and factories and tracks equipment for areas with potential for accidents and property damage. Right? And so as he does, he needs to fill in the data in the data table and then come back home. well, not home to his workspace and fill in that data table that looks like this. And we want to make the life of Dave better, right? Funnier, happier, more successful in so many ways. So, we can do that because when you look at a data table, as I was showing before, typically there are only few interactions because again people are exploring any interface through the lens of that city, right? And so when we look at this here, right, here we get what? Well, we have different buildings, country, city, state, address, and so on forth. And then we have different rankings, right? Plus, of course, we shouldn't be forgetting that we also have wonderful things here like risk quality modeling. I'm very curious. I really want to find out why it looks different and why it's all the way on the right, but that's different story probably. And so when Dave does this or explores a particular column, what is Dave doing here? What's his task? Why is he exploring one column at a time? Dave's job will not be replaced by AI. That's probably true. Prioritize, says Alex. Speed. But specifically, if you had to say, well, at this point Dave is doing X or Y. What is Dave doing here? Yes, that's a risk category indeed. Yes. So, Dave is comparing what? Losing his mind. That's um not Yes. So Dave at this point is actually comparing all the buildings that he has over here by a particular risk factor, right? But what does Dave do though do here right diving in and exploring in specific property right so there is that journey and then there is that journey now sometimes you would be looking at multiple rows and you'll be looking at multiple columns uh sometimes you have these different use cases in fact these are the two common use cases that you would have here comparing within a single column and view a single row detail Can we map that? Absolutely. That's straightforward. What we could do here is something like this. We wanted to optimize this for mobile. We could do this. We basically would have enabled that broad Dave to explore multiple categories, one or another or maybe a few, right? Or if they need to actually go in and um dive in deeper, well, we can do that, too. That's the same journey. That's easy. That's much easier than just putting a table on a map like that, right? Putting a table on mobile and call it a day. But you can also do a few other things. If you have a lot of stuff in your data table like maybe this, right? How would you map that into a mobile view? Because in a mobile view, obviously what we can have have can have of course is a horizontal scroll, but it's not a great experience, right? Well, one thing that I think could be very helpful and I highly recommend you to actually explore it as well is to introduce tabs within the table. So, what you have here is and this is a wonderful example from Neti, right? She got in and said, well, let me ex help people explore a particular set of data points or columns apps. So, I have a box score over here which shows you these six columns on off shows these six columns and overall which shows these six columns. So kind of matching or adding so to say uh well how many now? Uh five sorry it's five columns right 15 columns within three tabs five each. Now the problem is you can't see all at the same time right so maybe you should be able to customize and select what you want to see what you don't want to see as well. I think on its own it's actually a pretty neat idea to have right here. But overall when we look into tables it's not that groundbreaking right because what you have here is different types of data usually you know something like six or seven alpha numeric numeric icons badges simple charts or mini charts maybe and then the buttons right then when you look at alpha numeric they're left aligned numeric is right aligned icons is usually left aligned badges are centered simple charts are right aligned both for comparison right then you have action buttons that would leave over here. This will become of course very important when we're dealing with batch actions or stuff like that. But on the level of the components that we have, we'll have pretty few quite a few cells. Numeric, right? Sometimes they will have children, they might have status, they might have a bar chart. It can get very quickly, very very complicated, I have to say, especially when you're thinking about errors and error messages and different states that you might have there as well. So unsurprisingly quite quickly you might end up with something that looks like this right we might have different statuses you might have some action buttons over here you might also have some filtering or in like kind of live filtering over here this is coming from the visa design system a fantastic design system to explore as well right so it can actually become relatively quickly relatively complicated right but then especially when it comes to something like bulk actions I think where it really shows because I don't know if you worked on bulk actions or file uploading or batch actions or something like that it can become very difficult very quickly. Of course, a very common way of us to designing it is something like a checkbox pattern, right? This was visa design system uh V. So if you type in visa design system, you will find it, right? And what we have here is relatively straightforward. Whenever it comes to bulk actions, we have always two things. Actions bar and row actions. That's all you always have. Row actions on the level of individual row, right? And actions bar on the level of multiple rows. That means of course that when whenever you're selecting some of these checkboxes here, some of this this action bar will appear. Typically, we also might want to highlight what has been selected over here. And if too many things are selected, some people might want to filter them as well. By the way, depending on status and something like that, right? That's another story. And when it comes to those bulk actions, I found one example from Shopify in 2021, I believe, which I'm still very impressed by. I think it has changed now, but I want to show it to you because to me, this is a great example of how bulk editing can work, right? Um, it's sorry about the quality of this, but I think it's really fantastic. So, first of all, we have a lot of products here, right? And let's imagine that for all of those products, you might want to change something like reduce the price a little or change the category or rename or anything of that kind, right? And so, this I think is being explained here, right? So you select all these options. Of course this bar, this action bar appears. You can also select all products from the store, not only the ones that being displayed at the current view. Then you click on edit products. So it's bulk editing and then becomes kind of an Excel view, right? Plus on top of that you can also add your custom fields. Some of them are already available and visible here. You can also opt out and remove them if you like. Right? and then they disappear. So just a regular Excel view. Then you can just add any fields that you actually want to change. So if you might want to change the price everywhere, you might want to change inventory or anything else really, right? You just select whatever it is that you want to change. Remember, we saw something like this already with Yahoo 2. You basically select whatever it is that you want to change before you're changing it and then you change it, right? And then you select this part and that part and a few others. Right? And then you just add a tag on all of them at once like you would in Excel. Very straightforward and very simple as well. And of course, you know, this is showing up in many different places. This is coming from eBay [snorts] on eBay design system. It's the same story which I actually like as well because you can say not just I want to remove something but you can also add all of it at the same time or you want to share all of it and only those products that you have selected. in the same way. I think it's actually pretty cool. They also have a really big bunch of guidelines around bulk editing and file uploading which I highly encourage you to kind of play with as well. Just one more example I want to show here which is to indicate how simple some difficult things can be. Again, if you ever worked on bulk editing or bulk uploading, you will know that this is probably quite daunting. Well, because when you think about bulk operations, typically it has at least five stages. pre-import where you have to prepare people with something like template maybe or something like that. You have a file upload then you have a mapping then you have repairing of that mapping and then you have import. So that means that you would actually usually deal with something like this. This is a great example of this in action. First you tell people what format you're expecting. Do not expect people to follow through literally because people are strange creatures. So you prepare them first, then they upload. Whatever they upload is probably going to be incorrect, right? So you might want to make sure that they actually flagging if something isn't right. Then they upload the right file. Then from that point on, you go in and say, well, excellent, that's what we've have. But reality will often look a little bit different because whenever you do the mapping, right, it might be fine right away, but usually it will contain errors. And when you have errors, one little feature that can be extremely helpful is right here, only show rows with problems. If you have a big data set, this can be extremely daunting to go through dozens of pages to understand where the error actually is because they're sorted in a particular way, right? So you click on it and then you see only those rows that have a problem. You fix them, right? And then you basically have done all the work. This is so simple but it's very very difficult to get right. Right. It can be very very difficult to do to do well. [sighs and gasps] All right everyone. So I think I'm uh running on uh low on time here. So I just want to finish at this point and also leave time for all any question any questions that you might have. But I want to just really summarize very briefly what we have here. Basically, when we're dealing with complexity, we should not be underestimating it, but we should not be overestimating it either. Complex does not mean that it's unmanageable if it makes sense to people who are using it. It's not a bad thing. It's just a nature or attribute that you might have to might find in some environments. If you want to reduce cognitive load, then the best way to do that is frame into what people are using a lot and what kind of you want to enable people to reuse, right? things like presets or better defaults are always a good investment but also just to make sure that people don't have to keep a lot of stuff in the working memory. There's this very famous law of Miller's law about 7 plus minus two. We often misinterpreted in a way that it's like you have you must have at most seven plus minus two items in navigation. No, you just don't have to make people remember things too much. Example that I really have to show it. So I really really this is I'm really getting on my nerves. This is a bad idea to do this because if you are somewhere over here and you want to compare let's say some technical details right it's actively blocking your view. So you have to remember some data that you maybe were looking over here because you now have this data blocked or some other data that might be relevant blocked. That's not helpful also because there is no customize button. There is no way to customize the way of how columns are being displayed, what is displayed next to each other and so on. Have to remember and look all the time from left to right, jumping with the eye quite a bit to find what they're looking for. This is how you make people remember more stuff, which is absolutely unnecessary. This is just not a good idea. For example, having a dedicated panel right here when you click, let's say, on this part on this stock or whatever, it could be a good idea to show a dedicated panel over here pushing this column on the right. This would be much more efficient than hovering or blocking it. This is just not needed, right? or there is that uh whenever you actually have something like a task that you actually can create structure around like you need to do this first and then this first and then that and then that thing and then that thing that's usually helpful to create order around the work even if it's complex also can use navigation queries to help people move forward can have scroll bar range intervals for precise jumps as I was showing next to the scroll bar also for pagenation you must prioritize and dep prioritize to improve navigation filters typically above Search results can also be inline on the column, right? Relationship filtering is extremely efficient. Can be also a good alternative to tree uh data tree, right? Usually every single complex project will probably start with a task analysis. And I really have to show it. Sorry everyone. It's a good idea to use action dots to design around dashboards. So let me just show that because I think it's something I should not be skipping. Right. When we're looking into dashboards here everyone, there is this famous rule that I learned from a book on dashboard design. Dashboard design patterns. This is a wonderful website for that. Dashboard designpatters.io which showed this. This might look scary to some of you, right? But this makes so much sense why you actually start applying it. The idea behind it is whenever it comes to a dashboard, you will always have a situation where you have four different areas or four different attributes competing against each other. It's either screen space that wants to win or the level of abstraction has to go or the number of pages is going to increase or interaction is going to increase. And there are connections in between them. They are not random. It seems like there are too many arrows in one direction or the other. No, this is all makes sense making sense. If you think about the dashboard that you have to design, if you have a limited amount of screen space, right? If the amount of screen space decreases, then the level of abstraction has to increase because you can't show that much detail. At the same time, if the amount of screen space decreases, right, you'll have to increase interaction cost. People will have to navigate more. And also, if the level kind of screen space decreases, right, you will also then increase the number of pages. In the same way it actually operates in different way too. So if you want to let's say increase the uh reduce the level of abstraction and show more data right well then you have to need you kind of need more space right or what you also could do of course is increase the number of pages or what you also can do is increase interaction cost as well. So you can never get it perfectly done right. So you always need to do that. How do we do that? Great question. One simple way to deal with it, right, is to introduce something that Nick Deborah called uh action dash. Action dots dashboards. Let me show this here. Probably have to find it here. Action dots dashboard. This one, which I think is actually quite fantastic. So, I'm going to drop in the link here as well. This is just something that I put in uh oh, sorry, this is the right link. This is something that I wrote just a while back. But you basically first choose the right metrics together with your stakeholder who tells you what they want to see on the dashboard. Then for each of these metrics, you define these different sections. What's the crisis value? What's the actionably bad value, actionably good value that you might want to do something about it, and best case scenario, as long as a particular data point is staying within a particular range, you don't need to highlight it. So then then when you're designing a dashboard, what you actually do is you only highlight those things that fit within this or this area. Now for color blindness, it might be a good idea to replace red with another color like maybe blue or so, right? But you kind of highlight that part on the dashboard differently. So that would look like this. If we think about the particular experience like what we have maybe over here, right? [sighs] You know when we look at this going down is not necessarily a bad thing. Going up is not necessarily a good thing or bad thing. So very often people need to spend a lot of time reading the dashboard trying to understand what it actually means for them because ultimately the purpose of a dashboard is to make sure that it actually is actionable. Right? So how can we actually improve that then? Well, we could design something that will look much more like this. Right? This could also be a dashboard view. Right? where we basically take little space right but that space that we have we use to actually display important things you can imagine a little area displaying all important metrics like this here so if something is let's say red or so it requires attention something is blue uh it maybe is a good thing it requires attention right but above it you will be highlighting what exactly you need to do about tech support silver trail and light foot right this could be much better because then somebody can say well as long as everything else is in the same average okay area I don't need to do much about it I don't need to pay attention to that sometimes you'll find it being more a bit more detailed like this is an example from IBM carbon design system where they use also shapes to indicate different status indicators right which is a good idea for accessibility then as well and again in general it's a good idea to think about this color scheme which is again more color and friendly compared to what we have again with red and mean all right so this is actually the point that I wanted to bring up around that right [sighs] all right so with this finally right the final thing I want to mention is that probably want to avoid oversimplification this is always very dangerous and always very daunting this is how bad products emerge or how complex products that must be complex become very difficult to use so if you're looking for more of this I would like to highly invite you to explore the wonderful magical world that I've prepared for you because I also launched two video courses one of them was smart well free actually now one of them on smart interface design patterns you can also get a friendly coupon code maven 26 um to get access to video course and training on that tool also have a measure UX and design impact uh which is something if you want to articulate to your stakeholders how you contributed to an incredible impact on business that's maybe a course for you as well. And as I mentioned before, there is also a Maven course that I'm actually launching. Uh will actually starting I think in two weeks from now with this cats and more cats and thank you so much for being here everyone. Sorry for being a little bit chaotic. I think I had way too much coffee. I think way too much coffee but I hope there was something meaningful in there. Also just a quick reminder there's a Google doc right here. You'll find all the links over here as well, including slides too. Obviously, we went through like what 30% of all slides, maybe 25 or so. And also the links to the training are over here. Please take a look. Maybe that will be interesting for you as well, right? Um just don't forget to use the code if you sign up. Would love to see you there, of course. Right. Uh also, sorry everyone, please, if you have a moment, take a look at this design workflow. This is something that I just put together for me as a reference to keep in in mind. This isn't my process. This is usually something that we do in the course in in the training as well uh when dealing with complex products right uh the discovery the context and so on. Plus also what I usually ask customers or end users I should rather say depending on the users that we have to understand their top tasks right so hopefully I also can copy paste this as well here so you hopefully will find it meaningful and useful for you too and also just in case it's right here but also it's a Google doc where you will find design workflow updated over here hopefully it will make sense I tried my best to explain it in a way that would be helpful. Uh, plus a lot of other stuff here as well. [sighs and gasps] All right, I think this is it for now. I'm going to stay for another 15 minutes for any questions that you have everyone. But of course, if you have to leave um, feel free to leave. Thank you so much for joining. Otherwise, if you do have questions, I'm going to jump in on YouTube now to check if there are any questions. So, feel free to retype them in YouTube. Uh, and if you have questions here in Zoom, please write them as well so I can see them too. I hope you don't have a Dell you have to you don't have to go to Dell website anytime soon although it must have changed. I'm not quite sure. All right, so thank you so much for joining everyone. I'm going to jump in in the questions. Jessica is wondering in your day workshop you shared mirror stuff. Is it possible to get access to it again? Yes, Jessica, of course. please send me an email and I'll give you access to it as well. Probably going to be a bit difficult to do now. Anybody, by the way, if you're interested working together or anything, maybe this could be helpful for your team or whatever, right? Uh please drop me an email at bitsmission.com. I'll be happy to help. Okay, thank you so much, Laura. Uh uh hopefully not too much snow. mic. Uh, excellent. So, question from Flora. Hello, Flora. You talked about that left sidebar with icons with and without labels. You will cate for always adding a label as a starting point. Yes, I would always start with it, which is usually very common in UI and UX because an icon is not understandable by by itself, but doesn't depend on how often the product and its actions are used. For example, Figma left side, but they don't need labels for me. Good thinking. So I would say that heavily depends on the frequency of use because in the same way as people learn right how to use icons or what they mean they also forget that if the icon is obvious like search icon doesn't necessarily need an explanation but for accessibility reasons you still need to provide uh search for screen reader users right so one way or another you need to support that but you might not need to show it as search button Right? So you need a loop icon like the the search icon as a button, right? And usually it's a good idea to have search as well, but if people are using it all the time, that's probably doesn't matter indeed. In the same way, if people are using the same workflows and using the same flows over and over and over again, you know, you might not need it either, right? But again, if people are using the product every now and again and maybe using some islands of that product every now and again, then it might be a good idea to test if it actually would be better off to have it. Oh, hopefully indeed. I would love that. Right. So, jumping further here. Jakob is wondering, you mentioned about domain learning. How do you define how much learning is enough and how to make the case for the need or learning more now with the European Parliament for the last like what three years now and I feel now much more comfortable than this than I was let's say one and a half years ago. But I would still say that this whole world is very very confusing. A lot of terms and terminology vocabulary that is just outside of my control environment, right? I just have no idea what is going on here. I think I need enough to understand what people are doing to the point that I need to be covering at least these key user journeys. So key task that people are performing that's probably the most important part for me and then over time you can actually learn more but I try to at least get a very very good grisp grip and understanding about all the key top tasks that people are performing. This is kind of the step number one for me. Without it, I I cannot design anything. And frankly, if I'm being very honest, sometimes it's usually means sometimes usually it means unpaid research time because I have to understand what that is in the environment in which I am. And very often, I mean, maybe it's just me, I learned. I learned relatively slowly. So, it takes time for me to understand the new domain. Frankly, if I'm being very honest, like in I actually wish I would be jumping way more often between different domains when I was younger. Now I'm 40, right? And when I was 20, I was working in a um consultancy company, well digital agency rather, and I was jumping from one project to another every week. That was great. I learned a lot. But now jumping in any domain is a remarkably difficult and painful story for me. And usually I will not get the freedom to do three months desk research or even inerson research. That's just not given to me. So enough to cover the key use cases. This would be kind of my answer there. Alex is wondering, can you advice how to design multi select input? What is the best way? Because I saw a lot of options. Well, maybe Alex, if you could send me um an email, I can probably find an article that I wrote a while back about this. Um, black and check. Oska is writing this was a refresher. A thank you so much. Uh, well actually totally revamping this complex UI workshops. It will be very very different and probably a bit more complex. Google doc of course Google doc is not going anywhere. So feel free to use it in the future as well. Also feel free to share it with your friends and colleagues as well if you like. All right. Uh Lisa is wondering, could you please clarify uh how about send a multis sorting feature? Oh yes, good call. So let me just jump in. Uh a bit of an extra content over here. So I would say that the best example of multi sorting that I have seen is coming from air table. The multi I mean let me show this here. Okay, I think I can show this part over here. Yes, here we go. So this is coming from air table and on air table you have sorting button on the top. When you click on the sorting button you basically have an overview of the different kind of constructing and construct your own multi sort. You can say I want to sort by this and also want to sort by this and I want to sort by this and you can also pick another field to sort by. You can select because again sorting is always two dimensional. It's one direction or the other. Right? You can select if you want sort from first to last or from last to first, from empty to field, from field to empty, from one to nine, from 9 to one and add whatever else you want. Plus, whenever somebody's starting sorting or you maybe want to change the state, you can say I want it to be automatically changed or not. But it can also look a little bit different in the mobile environment. For example, you might want to say, well, let's have a sort button. Again, I would never call it multi sort by the way. Most people would not understand what it means. You can just sorting or sort and filter. It's fine if they're combined and you can actually map it this way. So you can sort by multiple things and there will be checkboxes. You could also be dragged. So you can actually define your priorities. But of course what you should be keeping in mind is that usually this is not enough because when you select it, you don't define the direction right from high to low, from low to high. What does it mean sort by priority? So usually we'll want to have something like this and enable people to choose in between as well, right? So or toggle in between in some way. That's a very nice and simple way to do this on mobile. But personally I would say overlay like this what you have on air table seems to be very kind of good call right also here I think you can say uh you can do a few more things. You can sort by fields by also removing them and also dragging them around. So this is I guess a different view that they had here as well. So that would be for me an a go-to example for that using tool tips. Um well tool tips or hover view, right? It's kind of the same story. It slows people down when we don't want them to be slowed down. I mean, if you have, let's say, five or six icons that are ambiguous, then people will be dancing between those icons, hovering over them, trying to understand which one is right for them. That's just a waste of time. But what you also still can do, and this is example that I like from intercom, right, is you can say, well, let people choose if they want to have an expanded view of that primary navigation, maybe even resize it if needed, although that's usually unnecessary, right? or if they want to have a collapse you right so that's sort of another option but usually I would say if it works in your test that's fine but typically not necessarily the greatest idea Jan is wondering what are your thoughts on the emerging trend of more internet being browsed by AI agents are we reaching the peak of UX it will be less relevant because we might need to focus more on data structure especially designing products that AI can understand as well I would say there are multiple layers to this. On the one hand, yes, a lot of products like e-commerce probably that are very similar anyway. They can be tasks can be very much automated there. But I would say that if you're dealing with expert software that we are looking at today like modeling software, things like that. I mean, I find it quite difficult to for people at least as of now to be trusting AI to the point that they can say, well, AI can model it for me. AI can do quite a bit of groundwork, but you still will need to be playing with that UI in some way. And that playing probably should be better than just writing in a text box to articulate something to a chatbot, right? It probably will need to have some presets and knobs and controls as well. They just might be automating some things that you would need to kind of articulate with much more precision in the past. And that's okay with me. But I don't think that those things will necessarily be kind of managed by agents. I mean, we're also dealing with situations again in fintech and in I know power grids simulations with things that rely on incredible amount of human expertise and accountability that AI just doesn't have. So I see some tasks being automated there, but a lot of tasks still staying within humans for good reasons. I think guys wondering how to convince a company that their company is actually complex and shouldn't treat it like in an out of the box in terms of UX. I would say that my way to articulate that would be to look at how resilient the application is because once you reach a particular peak at complexity, you will find people you will have a lot of people potentially employees probably um making a lot of mistakes or errors or just not being able to do what they want to do, not finding the right tools, not finding the right features, not finding the right ways of doing things. And so if you can make a point that a lot of people are struggling which is kind of a consequence of things being complex not matching the complexity of people using it then you might be better off. I mean we have to understand two things right on the one hand we have the complexity of the real world that in these environments must match the complexity that you provide with your UI or with your product right they must match but we shouldn't be forgetting that it also faces the complexity of not complexity the the expertise that people bring to the table and so in those environments you always have people who have to go through a very steep learning curve to get anywhere you will always have that And then there are people who have been around and using this product for a while. So they don't have that problem. Right? So if you have both of those cases, right, you might have experts being very comfortable with the product, but new engineers, new designers, new users feeling very challenged by it. They need to optimize for them, right? But ultimately the complexity is is not a bad thing at all. It's just there and it also must be somehow managed right in some way right you cannot reduce it but you can still help people manage it in some way so with templates presets and stuff like that so maybe that helps V is wondering do you have examples of platforms where applications or design systems with complex UIs that also have great visual languages yes absolutely I think for me the crucial part was hunting for them actually so if you look at enterprise design system link here. I tried to put together some of those that I find remarkable, really, really, really good. Right. Uh the one that I liked a lot, I would say, is the one from Visa. I mean, there are a lot of things over here. The one from Visa is fantastic. It's absolutely incredible. So, I can highly recommend you to look at it. The other one that was just renewed, which is coming from General Electric Healthcare, uh it was totally redesigned and it's great. It's really really great. It's also public. It's called Ethos for me. Wow, this is so good. It's just really really remarkable. So I highly recommend you to actually explore it as well. Um have a lot of patterns too and the one that I really shouldn't not be forgetting. Intention [music] Dr. Leip Dr. Leip design system oxygen design system oxygen. This is a great design system for B2B environment. However, I don't see it. Where's the design part actually of it? Hold on. Oxygen. Oxygen. Oh, here we go. This one. It's really really nice tool, right? So, feel free to take a look at the tool. This is a really, really good design system, especially if you look at components. Uh, I think what was that here? Sorry, patterns. They have this really incredible set of um decision trees. for example over here like this right and way more than that as well. Uh I just need to find it choosing a from components principalations. Oh damn it I always lose it but I wrote an article about this UI decision trees decision trees. You see my world is uh linked in somehow. So that's a little article they've put together about different decision trees and many of them are coming actually from Dr. Leap which is absolutely incredible. This is a like things like this. How to choose between the badge appeal a chip and stuff like that. Great great stuff. So feel free to take a look too. Oh sorry I actually just realized I actually didn't link it properly. I sent it to Phillip. Sorry about that, Philillip. Here we go. I just pasted in here to everyone. Right, everyone. So, maybe a few more minutes and then we'll wrap up. Um, a thank you so much, Jessica. Uh, Rachel is writing, I recommend that. Oh, thank you so much, Rachel, for recommending. Like to hear your opinion on this if you can answer the relationship between search and filter. Should the text search field be considered a part of the filter? Should the search input be at the top and the filters belong to it in some way? Both way works. I mean, sometimes you find the text box and then you have filters or chips next to it, right? That's all fine. I think a good example of this that I can show you because I kind of skipped it, right? Let me just show this. Uh, one of the good examples that I actually show could show you This sorting is something like this here. Is it this one? I think it was this one. Always losing things. Always losing things. Yeah, I think. Oh, here we go. I think it just this one. So, this is in general a good pattern to have. So, you can have search over here, right? Which kind of includes all of that. But usually would have search and then you would have filters right underneath. That's also works as well. The important thing that this selected filters or applied filters are not appearing here on the left. Right. Uh I don't see any search here. So, sorry about that. That's probably more confusing than helpful at this point. No, I don't think I have an example of that here. Um, but sometimes you just have both, right? Which is kind of fine too. I mean, it depends because if you have, let's say, um, five filters that are being selected, right, or six, then there is not much space for search to to kind of show anything, right? So, there could be a bit of an issue. Oh, here's an example I was looking for, right? which is kind of a query field from Goldman Sachs where you have search and then you can keep searching, right? And then you still have filters in there. But these filters could of course also leave at the bottom. Now the reason why they do this, by the way, is because they actually have suggested filters here. So as you keep typing here, they combining filters and search in one, which is also working. So I think it could work too. would love to hear your thoughts on the Salesforce design system. Well, Salesforce has a design system and it's a very accessible design system. I have to say when I was looking at it a while back, I was actually quite impressed. Uh, but I haven't been looking at it for a while now. So, I'm not sure Kay unless you are working at Salesforce in which case it's a fantastic design system. Of course. Right. Excellent. Well, thank you so much for joining everyone. Thanks for spending two hours with me uh looking into this madness of uh complex UIs. Well, if you're curious, the video link will be appearing here, but we also will you also will be receiving a link uh uh as you signed up for this tool uh probably within a couple of hours or so. So you can re-watch, share with your friends, colleagues and everybody else. Um, no strings attached and hopefully see you again soon. Hopefully maybe even very soon. There are a few links over here. Feel free to explore as well. Just say I was I was told to say that. Thank you so much for joining everyone and see you next time. Thanks everyone. Byebye. Thanks so much for coming everyone and see you again soon hopefully.",
