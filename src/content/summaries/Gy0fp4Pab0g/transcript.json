  "fullText": "I want you to look at this graph. Okay, this graph is an incredible graph cuz it is the birth and the death of a company. Now, often you don't get to see this ever, but here it is. Stack Overflow is dead. I don't know if you know this, but during the first full month of operation, they got 3,749 questions asked on the website. And during December 2025, there was 3,862 questions. It has officially gone back to month one. It's gone. So, I have a lot of things to say about this and I I'm going to tell you a story. I was actually called out in real life over a post I made on Stack Overflow, but first I think something even more kind of illustrative. We should chat about it for a second. You know, when I look at this graph and I see this, I see that Stack Overflow was long falling off before the AI boon hit. I mean, you can see co it went just to the moon, right? And then quickly fell off only like 2 months into the COVID spike. Obviously, people did not like the website long before AI existed. Stack Overflow is a toxic, horrible place designed to make dev kairens excel because giving them small amounts of power to power trip over people was just the way to create the dev care paradise. So, am I shocked or anything that Stack Overflow died? No, I'm not. But I think the thing that is still to this day so shocking is that Stack Overflow had one of the single greatest positions for the AI boom. It simply was only taken advantage of. Like I mean it is shocking. I'm not sure if there if if anthropic uh ow stack overflow money or what though AI did not kill the company. That would be the dev kairens. It certainly had a few nails and profited so much off of Stack Overflow. Oh my gosh. This is something that this will be studied for the ages. A company so thoroughly positioned to benefit off the boom of AI completely collapses under the weight of a Karen. Damn. Insane, right? Okay. But the the real thing is that when I see this, I know I'm like laughing at it. Yeah, screw that. But if you if you were a dev as old as I am, okay, old is dirt here. This time period right here, this was a pretty sweet time period, okay? Because this was the time period in which I was beginning to become a webdev. I was a Java/Cade dev working on robots and and like offline uh web or web applications, regular ass applications using the Java swing framework. And so when I moved over to the web and Ubuntu, it was quite the experience for me. And honestly, Stack Overflow, it was incredible. Stack Overflow helped me get to where I was. I could look at so many questions and it was honestly incredible. It was like nothing else at the time. And honestly, there's part of me that when I look back on the kind of like the nostalgia hits, you know what I mean? The nostalgia hits hard. And so when I see this graph, it's it's not that I'm like I I am happy in some sense that people don't have to deal with just that the crap moderation, but on the other hand, just feel sad, you know? It just still feels a little sad, you know, because like one game I used to play way way back in the day was how to trigger people. Like look at this question right here. What is more pythonic for not? Oh my gosh, look at this. If not for NA versus if for not an A. Yeah, I was click Dude, fellas. I was click baiting devs long before YouTube was even in my uh purview. Okay, I I've been I've been out there just triggering people. Oh my gosh, I had so much fun asking the stupidest questions that I could possibly come up with to see if I can farm a little bit of that Stack Overflow karma. But alas, that time period has been long over. As you can see here, that question was 12 years and 5 months ago. Dude, damn. I was like 27 at the time, thinking it was hilarious. But I will say my favorite story about Stack Overflow, one that for me will go down as like a personal mark of pride and dignity was way back in the day. Okay, this was like 3 years ago, so not that far back in the day. I was at a conference, okay, a Versel conference, okay, it was lots of triangles. We were all wearing black turtlenecks. It was an incredible experience. and somebody was at the table worked for Stack Overflow and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, someone still works at Stack Overflow.\" So naturally, I had to start asking some questions, see what he did around there. You know, that's it just feels weird. It's like finding someone that still works for Yahoo. You know, you're just like, \"Damn, son, you work for Yahoo?\" Which, by the way, I did know someone that worked at Yahoo. And that was pretty much my response. And this was like eight years ago. I was just like, \"Damn, you was a warer at Yahoo.\" Uh, anyways, we were chatting. And I was just like, \"Man, Stack Overflow, you know, I used to ask I used to ask some funny questions. In fact, I I even got in trouble for one of my questions.\" And he was just like, \"Wait a second. Are you the dict guy?\" I did not seed that. Okay. I did not be like, \"You know, I one time trolled.\" No, no, no. I was just like, you know, I got in a little trouble for a question I asked once on that. Apparently, there is a there is a bit of a slack bit of a little bit of slack chatter and I am one of the infamous question askers on the old Stack Overflow. Now, unfortunately, I cannot get the Stack Overflow post. That post was deleted. I checked the way back machine. It does not seem to have it. So, I just can't get access to it. But I do have the moderation email. And I thought I would just read you the moderation email cuz this is just how good it was. Now, the question of course is called the best way to measure your dict. And you can imagine I got both hands on that question. I really just churned out the best possible question that I could muster. So, the moderation email goes like this. Your question, the best way to measure your dictes was deleted as rude/abbrasive because it appears to have deliberately crafted to have multiple sexbased double entras. How thoroughly you wo the double entras into your question was impressive, but it also made it clear that doing so was intentional. And now I love that. And you know what? I can't be upset. This is the only one action of moderation that I'm not upset about. They even recognized game. Okay, game recognized game in that one. They said they they were impressed. Okay, I love that. I love the fact that they were even able to say, \"Okay, it was pretty good. We're not going to ban you. We're just going to say don't do that again. Okay, you took effort. At least you're trolling with high effort.\" So, when I see this graph, there's a part of there's there's a small part of me that's a little bit like it's a little little sad about it. There's a huge part of me that's pretty happy about it. It's bittersweet, for sure. Honestly, I think it's just really easy to cheer for the death of Stack Overflow, but it also played a pretty pivotal role in my early webdev days. So, it's hard to just spit on that grave. Okay, I'm not out there giving the old peace sign next to the grave. No, I'm actually It's a little sad, you know? It's like seeing the thing that was ruined from your childhood finally get cancelceled. You know, you're like happy that because it got ruined from your childhood, but also sad because it was part of your childhood, you know?
