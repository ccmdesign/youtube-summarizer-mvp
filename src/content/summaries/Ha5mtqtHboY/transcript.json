  "fullText": "We often demonize the smartphone as the the locust of all of our fragmentation and and uh collective derangement. I I think that's true, but obviously there are different uses of a smartphone, and this is certainly one that I can stand behind as being just categorically different from the other stuff that's driving us crazy. Um and I I I view most surely most of um the audio I consume on a phone which is a lot as um some version of of you know very productive and and unifying of my attention. I mean, you know, I listen to good books and and and good conversations and um you know, obviously, you know, listening to guided meditations and meditation instruction is is um I think the ultimate example of a good use of attention on this device, which is just not at all analogous to having your your attention, you know, shattered on the regular by um social media engagement and and kind of the the dopamineeric um you know, checking in for, you know, to to the response to the response to the response. Um, so yeah, I think waking up is is I mean I I love what we've created over there and I think it's um it's a great use of of the the device, you know. >> Can you give us some examples of what types of results one could expect once they develop this skill that could uh I think honestly takes somebody about a week to really begin to see something. But you know, what kind of results can one expect? >> Yeah, I love these questions. These are this is exactly the the way I come at it. Um hope the irony was detectable there. I mean so there there kind of two sides to this topic, right? There's the the um conventional mainstream pitch for mindfulness that that you know here here's a list of benefits you can expect from the practice. And um most of what is claimed there I think is true. True. I mean, say some of it is is, you know, poorly researched or at least the research is kind of thin and, you know, some of it might wa wash out. But the thing that is is obviously true is that virtually everyone until they learn to practice mindfulness in some form is spending their life perpetually distracted. And they're so distracted they're not even aware of that, right? They're thinking every moment of their lives. their their moment to moment experience of of being a self in in the world is being filtered through this discursive conceptually framed uh conversation they're having with with themselves. And again, the conversation is is so incessant and so loud that it achieves this kind of white noise status where people don't aren't even aware that they're distracted. Half the people hearing hearing me say this who have never tried to meditate will be thinking what the hell is he talking about? Right? But it's that it's that voice in the mind. What the hell is he talking about that feels like you? That's the endless conversation that is defining your experience moment to moment. And it's the the medium on which all of your dissatisfaction and frustration and regret and annoyance and and uh you know everything that makes you an [ __ ] in the world. It is the medium that that transmits that and makes it actionable in emotionally and behaviorally moment to moment. It's like it's the capture by thought unwittingly, right? The the impulse that you can't see creep up from behind that just becomes you, that becomes your, you know, the next thing you say, the next thing you reach for, the next thing you aspire to to become. I mean, it's just again, we're we're living in a dreamscape and virtually nobody notices. So when you try to practice meditation for the first time really any form of meditation but you know mindfulness in particular you're you initially you're given this very basic exercise of just try to pay attention to the breath you try to pay attention to sounds you know moment by moment and every time you notice you're lost in thought come back to the the feeling of breathing or the the the sounds in your environment or the the sense of your your body resting in space or just some sensory experience that you can use to to try to build some concentration on. And it is a you know it's if you persist in it long enough to notice how hard that is uh and how um vulnerable your attention is in in every present moment to the next thought arising unrecognized and just seeming to become you. It is a kind of revelation. I mean albeit a negative one. I mean, you just what you you what you recognize in yourself is this pervasive incapacity to pay attention to anything for more than a few moments at a time without being distracted. And it's very hard. But whatever you think about meditation from that moment forward, maybe you think it's just too much of a hassle, you know, you're too restless, it's too hard, you don't have a talent for it, you know, you're going to move on to other things and you kind of bounce off the project. What even if you're fall into that condition, it's I think it should be very hard to to argue to yourself that that this is somehow psychologically optimal to not be able to pay attention to something for more than a few moments of at a time and to be helplessly buffeted by the winds of your own distraction. >> I had a good thought actually about that. I wanted to run by you. There's this idea of sort of like a dealer dealing cards like thoughts >> and imagine sitting you know, at the at the card table, blackjack table, just every time just waiting for the cards and just no, don't want to play that card. No, just you can wait for a blackjack every time if you know how to wait for the cards. You don't have to play the card that's dealt. You can say, I don't want that one. Don't want that one. And everyone at the table is looking at you like, >> \"This guy's cheating.\" And it's kind of like cheating. But if you have that skill, >> it's kind of cool. >> Oh, yeah. I mean, it's each the cards are thoughts, right? Thoughts taken seriously. Yeah. So, you know, the the voice of your mind says, uh, I can't believe how you [ __ ] that up, right? And okay, so how much So, what does that what does that convey? Right? Like how much shame or regret or what do you do with that? You don't have to do anything with it, right? >> Tell the dealer to give you another card. >> Yeah. I mean, there's this image in in um Tibetan Buddhism of uh you know, ultimately thoughts are like thieves entering an empty house, right? there's nothing for them to steal, right? So that like just imagine what that's like. Imagine just imagine the the scene of, you know, thieves come, you know, storming into a house that has nothing in it, right? I mean, there's no implication of their presence there, right? That there's nothing for them to do. Um, thoughts, you know, thoughts recognized are just these mysterious mental objects, right? Right?
