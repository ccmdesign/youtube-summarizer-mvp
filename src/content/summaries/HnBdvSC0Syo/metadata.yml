  ________________________________
  What’s really happening inside prompt engineering and the full lifecycle behind it?
  The common story is that prompting is just writing clever text — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on the real prompt lifecycle:
  • Why intent formation is the missing first stage
  • How LLMs help shape, version, and test high-leverage prompts
  • What separates individual tinkering from production-grade evaluation
  • Where AI agents and deployment workflows demand rigorous prompt tooling
