  What’s really happening inside prompt engineering and the full lifecycle behind it?
  The common story is that prompting is just writing clever text — but the reality is more complicated.
  
  In this video, I share the inside scoop on the real prompt lifecycle:
  • Why intent formation is the missing first stage
  • How LLMs help shape, version, and test high-leverage prompts
  • What separates individual tinkering from production-grade evaluation
  • Where AI agents and deployment workflows demand rigorous prompt tooling

  The critical missing stage in AI prompting is **Intent Formation and Discovery**, which must occur before actual drafting.
  - **Stage One** involves refining 'fuzzy goals' into structured objectives.
  - **Stage Two** is the actual authoring and drafting of the prompt.
  - Moving from ambiguous requests to **high-lever prompts** requires clarifying constraints and specific operational steps.

## Key Takeaways

Effective prompting requires a fundamental shift from immediate drafting to a dedicated discovery phase.

* **Intent Formation** is the necessary 'Stage 1' that defines exactly what you want before writing a single word of a prompt.

* **Fuzzy Goals** like 'summarize this' or 'draft a plan' often fail because they lack the structure and specific objectives needed for high-quality output.

* Even **advanced prompters** struggle with intent formation when working quickly, leading to results that are unambiguous but lack strategic depth.

* Most current AI tools are designed for the **authoring stage** rather than the complex process of figuring out what the actual intent is.

## Summary

### The Missing Layer of Prompting
Nate B Jones argues that most AI users jump straight into 'Stage 2' of the prompting process: the authoring and drafting phase. By skipping the initial layer of **Intent Formation and Discovery**, users often produce prompts that are too vague or 'fuzzy' to yield optimal results. This issue is particularly prevalent among beginners, but even experts succumb to it when trying to move too quickly through their workflow.

### Moving Beyond Fuzzy Goals
When users start with a prompt such as 'summarize this' or 'analyze the sentiment,' they are operating with a fuzzy goal. This lack of clarity leads to inconsistent outputs. The transition from a general idea to a **high-lever prompt** requires a deliberate process of uncovering the specific objective, identifying the necessary constraints, and outlining the exact steps the AI should take. High-lever prompts act as tools that do the heavy lifting, but they cannot be constructed without first refining the underlying intent.

### The Drafting vs. Discovery Paradox
Drafting is the act of putting words to paper, but discovery is the act of mental mapping. Nate Jones suggests that when we skip discovery, we are essentially building a house without a blueprint. We might know we want a 'house' (the summary), but we haven't decided on the floor plan (the constraints and steps). For individuals, the struggle isn't just about prompt syntax; it's about decision-making. By identifying that **Stage One** is actually about intent, we can slow down and ask: What is the ultimate objective? What are the non-negotiable constraints? What logical path must the AI follow?

### The Need for Better Tools
The video concludes by noting that existing AI interfaces aren't particularly well-suited for the kind of **intent formation** required to handle real-world complexity. To solve this, users must consciously prioritize the discovery phase to transform high-level intent into a structured set of instructions that are **unambiguous** and highly functional.

## Context

As generative AI becomes more integrated into professional workflows, the bottleneck has shifted from 'knowing how to talk to the AI' to 'knowing exactly what you need the AI to do.' This video highlights a common friction point where users experience frustration with AI outputs not because of the model's limitations, but because of a failure to define the mission clearly at the start. This insight is crucial for knowledge workers and AI strategists who are moving beyond simple chat interactions toward complex, automated systems that require high-precision prompting to be truly effective.
