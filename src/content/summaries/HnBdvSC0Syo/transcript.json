  "fullText": "I am here to tell you that you are missing a stage in the prompting layer. What if we thought of our first piece authoring and drafting as stage two not stage one because it is because when you think about where you want to go with prompting it's actually intent formation and discovery that has to happen first and then you get into authoring. And what I have found is that intent formation for individuals is really hard. And this, I'll be honest with you, is definitely something that is more true the earlier you are in your AI journey and you are still trying to figure out how how prompting actually works. Basically, if you're trying to write a prompt quickly and formulate your intent quickly and you don't have the time to do it and you may be an advanced prompter, you still run into the same issue because you have a fuzzy goal. you summarize this, draft a plan, analyze the sentiment, and now you need to get to a structured, unambiguous, high lever prompt that is going to clarify the objective and the constraints and the steps. And you know that you should. But what I have found is that those tools by themselves aren't super well suited to the kind of intent formation that we're doing at this stage. What I'm picturing for you is the realworld complexity that I feel that others feel when they're trying to craft prompts. And to be honest with you, there hasn't been a great tool for that.",
