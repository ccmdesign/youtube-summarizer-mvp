  AWS Solutions Architect Question of the Day | Question 20 of 65


  🔥 Concept Focus: DDoS vs Application Attacks

  - In AWS security design, treat these as two separate problems:

  - Volumetric / DDoS attacks → handled at the network & edge layer

  - SQL injection & malicious requests → handled at the application layer with
  inspection and rules


  High-traffic architectures usually combine an edge-based DDoS service with a
  web application firewall in front of the load balancer or CDN.


  👉 Follow this pattern whenever you see “DDoS + SQL injection” in exam
  questions.
