  description: "Want to make your AI agent smarter without reprogramming it? In this video, I break down Skills in Google Antigravity—a powerful way to give your agent extra knowledge and specialized capabilities.


    While \"Tools\" let an agent execute code, \"Skills\" give them the instructions and best practices they need to handle specific workflows exactly how you want them to.


    I'll walk through a real-world demo: creating a custom Skill that encourages the agent to generate consistent, emoji-filled Git commit messages for your team.

## Key Takeaways

This video introduces the concept of **AI agent skills** and demonstrates their practical application with **Google Antigravity**.

- **AI agent skills** provide agents with additional knowledge and capabilities, much like sending them to school, allowing them to evolve without requiring a complete reprogramming. They are distinct from the **tools** agents already use.

- Skills enable agents to adapt their behavior and responses based on specific training, ensuring consistency and adherence to standards, as showcased by enforcing **conventional Git commit messages**.

- In **Google Antigravity**, skills are defined in `skill.md` files using **YAML front matter** for metadata and detailed instructions. These files can be applied locally to a workspace or globally for a team, shaping how the agent performs tasks.

- The primary benefit is achieving **consistent outputs** and making agents more versatile and aligned with specific requirements, such as generating standardized commit messages.

## Summary

The video, "Introduction to AI Agent Skills with Google Antigravity," by Cloud with Karl, explains a new concept in AI agent development: **skills**. It differentiates skills from tools and demonstrates their application using Google Antigravity.

### Understanding Agents, Skills, and Tools
An **AI agent** is defined as an entity capable of planning and solving problems independently. Complementing agents are **tools**, which are pieces of code agents can use to perform tasks. The new concept introduced is **skills**, which provide agents with extra knowledge and capabilities, metaphorically like sending an agent to school for specialized training. A key benefit of skills is that they allow an agent to gain new expertise and adapt to evolving circumstances without needing a full reprogramming. For instance, an agent assisting an auto mechanic could be given new skills on electric vehicles (EVs) or new car models, allowing it to better utilize its existing diagnostic tools without being rebuilt from scratch.

### Practical Demonstration with Google Antigravity
The video demonstrates the practical application of skills through a scenario focused on achieving **consistent Git commit messages** for a team using Google Antigravity. The goal is for the agent to analyze staged changes and suggest commit messages that adhere to a common standard, which can be particularly useful for ensuring uniformity and clarity in development workflows.

To implement a skill, a `skill.md` file is created. This file contains **YAML front matter** at the top, which includes metadata like the skill's name (e.g., "emoji commits skill") and a brief description. Below the front matter, detailed instructions are provided, outlining how the agent should behave or what standards it should enforce. In the demo, this skill guides the agent to produce conventional, "sparkly" commit messages.

### Applying and Utilizing Skills
Once defined, skills can be activated for an agent. By renaming the `skill.md` file to `agent.md` and placing it within a specific workspace, the skill becomes relevant only to that workspace. Alternatively, placing the `agent.md` file in the general Google Antigravity folder makes the skill apply globally across all agent interactions. The demonstration shows that when the agent is prompted to create a Git commit message for staged changes, it analyzes the `skill.md` (now `agent.md`) file. This analysis enables the agent to connect the task with the defined skill, shaping its response to produce a commit message that adheres to the specified standard, such as an "orchestrator agent pattern" or a "sparkly" format. This process ensures that agents consistently provide outputs aligned with desired team or individual preferences.

The core takeaway is that skills empower AI agents with additional, modular knowledge, allowing them to adapt their responses and perform tasks according to specific guidelines without requiring extensive reprogramming, thereby enhancing their utility and consistency.

## Context

This video on AI agent skills is highly relevant for anyone involved in **AI development**, **MLOps**, or **Dev

Ops**, particularly those integrating AI into enterprise workflows. As AI agents become more sophisticated and prevalent, the ability to rapidly imbue them with new, specialized knowledge without constant reprogramming is crucial for **scalability** and **maintainability**. This concept addresses the growing need for AI systems that are not only powerful but also adaptable, consistent, and easy to manage across various applications, from code generation to complex problem-solving. It signifies a move towards more modular and human-friendly ways to control and enhance AI behavior.
