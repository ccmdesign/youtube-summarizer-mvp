  "fullText": "Hello, I'm Tony Co, the host of Talk IT Global. Amid the sudden wave of AI, many companies are struggling to figure out the right direction for enterprise AI. In today's seminar, I'd like to share the three pieces of advice that Andrew Ang, founder of Google Brain and leading AI scholar at Stanford, recently offered to organizations adopting AI at a snowflake event. Among them, Andrew Ang emphasizes that the biggest opportunity lies in the enormous amount of PDF-based unstructured data stored inside companies. Once AI powered document extraction technology unlocks the value hidden in this massive data and connects it with a company's existing structured data, the level of decision-making and automation inside the enterprise will fundamentally change. Personally, I believe that as physical AI becomes more widespread, the unstructured data generated by enterprises such as audio and video will amplify this opportunity even further. One mega trend is uh was spent last 20 years. You know, you guys have done been a big part of this architecting structured data. A big unlock is going to be unstructured data that AI can finally make sense of. >> And I have a weird focus on one type of unstructured data. It turns out I think the single most valuable form of unstructured data >> dark data sitting in all of our businesses is PDF files. Y >> I know it sounds dumb but we have so many of them. So I've been actually very excited about some of the work that my friend Dan Maloney has been doing on agentic doc extraction y to take these massive trolls of PDF files in finance healthcare you know giant financial tables healthcare forms sitting in there tons of value and you can extract it out with aentic doc extraction it um the number of use cases I'm seeing skyrocket there are other types of unstructured data they're valuable too but PDF files has been a is a surprisingly big one >> the second piece of advice when Building AI, the first thing a company should focus on is not technology or cost but creating features that users immediately feel are absolutely necessary. So for a lot of new innovative projects so you know my team at AI fund build a lot of new startups the biggest challenge is um identifying building a product that customers love not cost. >> You're saying product market fits the >> product market fit first. So what what I'll often do is you know just do whatever uh just work to build that good product and then sometimes we've been fortunate to hit product market fit and then you know the cost start climbing and then starts to look scary in terms of the cost but at that time we often find engineering methods to then bend the cost curve back down. So, oh there's one other thing I tend to do. We do tend to do a little bit of work up front >> to architect for choice for for downstream model optionality. Uh which you can often do with just a little bit of extra work. Um and then >> frankly the cost come down so fast enough that is a wonderful problem to have which I have had a couple times but you know not that I wish I had that problem more often. And there we have so many users that that the cost are climbing. Um it's wonderful you can get to that problem because the future of AI is changing incredibly fast. The most important strategy for companies today is optional flexibility. The ability to choose Andrew Ang stresses that the key to achieving this is owning your own data layer. >> Owning your own data layer turns out to be a really important part of that. >> That's right. >> So there are a lot of you know SAS vendors, right? I won't name any but whenever you hire a SAS vendor many of them would try to create a silo inside your own organization >> I call it box in a cloud >> I see so I find that um of course you need some place to host your data but if you can control your own data and hire vendors operate on your data it gives you a lot more optionality to then swap vendors do other things with it in the future it makes sense for everyone to learn to code and don't code by hand don't do the old way get AI to help you to code and that will make people in all job functions uh much more productive and have more fun. >> Lastly, your likes and subscriptions greatly empower us to continue creating content.
