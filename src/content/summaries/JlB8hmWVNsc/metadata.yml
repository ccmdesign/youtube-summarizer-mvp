title: My Actual Personal Brand Strategy For 2026
description: >-
  Your competitors can copy your product, your pricing, and even your ads… but
  they can’t copy the trust you build when people already know who you are.
  After two decades of building my personal brand (and scaling NP Digital into
  one of the world’s largest marketing agencies), I can tell you this: your
  personal brand is one of the most powerful competitive advantages you can
  build in 2026.


  In this video, I’m breaking down my actual personal brand strategy for
  2026—the exact 3-pillar approach I use to build trust faster, reduce marketing
  costs, and create compounding growth over time. With AI making content easier
  and louder than ever, trust is becoming the real filter that decides who wins.
  That’s why personal branding is no longer “nice to have”… it’s your modern-day
  moat.


  If you want more customers, better partnerships, stronger conversions, and a
  brand that people search for (not just scroll past), this breakdown will show
  you the system I’d follow if I were starting over today.

  kicks in
