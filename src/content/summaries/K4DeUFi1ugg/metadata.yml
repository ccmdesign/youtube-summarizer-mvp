title: '"Time is a River": Why 70+ Models Gave the Exact Same Answer'
description: >-
  A massive research paper published in October 2025 reveals a critical failure
  mode in the current state of AI: The Artificial Hivemind. Despite the illusion
  of choice in the market, major LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama are
  increasingly converging on the exact same outputs, killing creativity and
  reducing diversity.


  In this video, we break down the data behind "Inter-Model Homogeneity" and
  what it means for developers building on these APIs. The study proves that
  standard tricks like increasing temperature often fail to produce real
  semantic diversity, and that "multi-model routing" architectures might just be
  giving you the same answer rephrased. We analyze the "Time is a River"
  experiment, why RLHF acts as a creativity funnel, and the few open-source
  outliers that still offer a glimmer of divergent thinking.
