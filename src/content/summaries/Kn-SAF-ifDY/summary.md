## Key Takeaways

This week's tech briefing covers major AI integrations and research revealing how teams are adopting new tools. Key insights include:

*   **AI moves into collaboration platforms:** Anthropic's **Claude Code** now integrates with Slack for 'collaborative debugging,' allowing teams to delegate and fix bugs directly in chat, reflecting a shift away from traditional IDEs.

*   **New tools for managing AI output:** Google unveiled **Artifacts**, a feature for reviewing AI agent work (like code reviews) within its IDE, while also upgrading tools like **Mixboard** for AI-generated presentations and **Stitch** for prototyping.

*   **Research reveals practical AI use:** A Perplexity/Harvard study found **productivity tasks (36%)** are the leading use case for AI agents, with users comfortable outsourcing research but wanting control over final actions like purchases.

## Summary

**Slack becomes an AI development hub** with the beta launch of Anthropic's Claude Code integration. This allows product teams to ping the AI assistant within Slack channels to identify and fix production bugs using chat context, a process termed 'collaborative debugging.' This strategic move comes as OpenAI plans its own workplace tools, and Salesforce (Slack's parent) sees its AI platform, **Agent Force**, reach $540M in annual recurring revenue.

**Google introduces new AI-powered product tools**, most notably **Artifacts** for managing and reviewing the work of AI agents directly in its IDE. It also upgraded **Mixboard** to transform mood boards into Google Slides and added **Prototypes** to **Stitch**, its 'vibe coding' design app, for creating clickable user flows.

**Research provides data on real-world AI agent use.** A Perplexity and Harvard study of its **Comet browser** found:

*   **Productivity (36%)** is the top use case, followed by learning/research and media.

*   Within productivity, document editing and account management are most common.

*   Users delegate research (e.g., flight booking) but expect to regain control for final transactions like purchases.

**OpenAI's enterprise report** shows non-technical workers are increasingly using AI for coding, with a 36% average increase in coding-related messages from non-engineers. However, the **SaaS growth landscape is shifting**; median annual recurring revenue growth has fallen from 36% in 2021 to 15% in 2025, partly due to the rise of internally built 'vibe coded' tools.

**Other notable developments** include Instacart launching the first embedded end-to-end shopping experience in ChatGPT using the new **Agentic Commerce Protocol**, and Figma releasing new AI image-editing features for erasing objects and expanding backgrounds.

## Context

This briefing matters for product managers, developers, and business leaders navigating the rapid integration of AI into daily workflows. It highlights the strategic pivot from standalone AI tools to embedded assistants within existing collaboration platforms like Slack, and the emerging need for systems to manage AI-generated output. The research data provides crucial insights into how users actually interact with AI agents, moving beyond hype to practical application. These trends signal a fundamental shift in software development, design processes, and enterprise productivity tools.
