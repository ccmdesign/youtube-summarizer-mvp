title: "Claude Code Debacle: OpenCode, AI Coding"
description: >-
  Anthropic made a move to narrow down their subscription against third party
  applications like OpenCode. As competition among AI Coding agents grow, we
  need to dig into really why this matters and more importantly, how we got to
  where we are today from GitHub Copilot to Claude Code and now more AI coding
  modes like OpenAI GPT-5.2 Codex, GLM 4.7, MiniMax M2.1 and more. Let's take a
  look at the AI coding industry and analyze the AI industry in its implications
  among other tools like Aider, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cline, Roo, Windsurf,
  Cursor, and more piles on.
