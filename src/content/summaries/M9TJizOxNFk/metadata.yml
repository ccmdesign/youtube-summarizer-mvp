  What's really happening with AI strategy in 2026? The common story is that one company cares about safety and one does not — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on why OpenAI and Anthropic have diverged so completely:

   • Why Sam Altman and Dario Amodei have fundamentally different theories of safety
   • How YC training shaped OpenAI's ship-fast philosophy
   • What Anthropic's scientist-founder learned from personal tragedy
   • Why we're now in two AI economies, not one

  Both leaders believe safety matters. Sam believes safety emerges from deployment — the public teaches you what internal testing cannot. Dario believes safety is a precondition — you prove it works before putting it in people's hands. These different epistemologies have produced entirely different products.

  For professionals choosing their AI tools, the question is no longer which model is better — it's what kind of work you're doing.
