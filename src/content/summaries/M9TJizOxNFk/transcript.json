  "fullText": "Today we're going to look at which AI strategy is going to win in 2026. There are really two theories about how to build AI safely and at scale. Two strategies, two philosophies that have been diverging since 2021 and they've now produced completely different companies, completely different products and increasingly different markets. I'm talking about Claude and I'm talking about Chat GPT. One theory says you learn by deploying, ship fast, get feedback from millions of users and iterate and the public is effectively your red team for safety. The other theory says you must understand before you deploy. You must prove it's safe first. The lab is the lab, not the world. Open AAI bet on the ship it fast strategy. Enthropic bet on the ship it carefully strategy. And by January 2020, we can finally see what each bet has produced in the market. And more importantly, we can start to see which strategy is winning for whom. And here's what most people get wrong. This is not a story about one company being reckless and one being cautious. I think that's a gross oversimplification. Both Sam Alman and Daario Amade believe safety matters. They just have fundamentally different theories about how you achieve it. And those theories trace back to who those two leaders are, where they came from, and what they learned before they touched AI. For 2 years, really from late 2023 to late 2025, the entire AI conversation was organized around a single question. Which model is better? Benchmark comparisons, arena scores, vibes testing. The question made sense when both companies seemed to be racing toward the exact same finish line. But sometime in late 2024, the paths forked and they kept forking through 2025 and it just took a while to figure it out. By January 2026, the divergence has be become so complete that comparing Claude and Chad GPT, I find, is like asking whether a hospital or a television studio is better, quote unquote. They're both buildings. They both use electricity, but they serve entirely different purposes. And I think that's increasingly true of Claude and Chat GPT. Here's what most people miss. This divergence was not an accident of strategy. It was not a result of market positioning. I believe it was inevitable from the moment these companies were founded because it's encoded into the DNA of the leaders of the companies. Sam Alman and Daario Amade are not different CEOs with different business plan. They're different kinds of people with different theories of how progress works and most critically different theories of how safety happens in artificial intelligence. And so to understand why these two companies diverge so completely, you have to understand where these two men came from. Daario was born in San Francisco in the early 90s. His dad was an Italian-American leather craftsman. His mom worked as a project manager for libraries. I guess that was before product management. It's a household that valued craftsmanship. It valued systematic thinking, attention to detail. But what really set Amade apart was his orientation toward knowledge. In interviews, he's been remarkably clear about this. I was interested almost entirely in math and physics. He said, writing some website actually had no interest to me whatsoever. I was interested in discovering fundamental scientific truth. Think about that for just a second. This is the CEO of one of the most valuable artificial intelligence companies on the planet who has shipped a product that numerous people are using to build websites. And he's telling you that the entire culture of the valley, the apps, the products, the startups, has held no appeal to him whatsoever. He's not drawn to building the things that people are using day-to-day, the things that drive the valuations, ironically, right? He's a CEO of a startup. He's drawn to understanding how things work. He's a scientist. Amade started at Caltech studying physics, transferred to Stanford to complete his bachelor's degree, and then went went on to Princeton for his PhD. And there he studied something deeply relevant to his future work. The electrphysiology of neural circuits. He was literally trying to understand how biological neurons process information and how brains work at the level of individual cells and their collective behavior. But something tragic happened at Princeton that has shaped everything that has come since for him. His father died of a rare illness. And just four years later, a medical breakthrough turned that previously fatal disease into one that was nearly curable. that the timing is so painful and is familiar to anyone who has suffered from a chronic disease. The cure can exist at the wrong point in time. The cure can come too late. And it seems like this experience really crystallized something for him because ever since we've seen a focus in his career on scientific advancement on the value of scientific knowledge. Amade subsequently shifted his research focus from theoretical physics toward bioysics and computational neuroscience work that addressed human illness directly. Now when he went on to found a company that philosophy stayed with him in fact I would argue it continues to define a lot of anthropics build approach and philosophy and a lot of what we can in turn expect from them in 2026 and beyond. Now let's revisit Sam Alman. Let's contrast this. Alman was born in 1985 in St. Louis, Missouri. He learned to program very, very early at 8. He went on to Stanford to study computer science and then immediately dropped out and founded a company, a social networking app that failed. The market wasn't ready. User retention was low. We've all been there. Certainly, most founders have been in places where they failed. But Altman was different than a lot of other founders. He did not experience that failure as a cautionary tale about moving too fast. He experienced it as a lesson in iteration. Failure is simply an opportunity to begin again. He said this time more intelligently. And so he joined Y Combinator and became first a partner and then the president of YC. And Y Combinator has shaped so much of OpenAI's approach. Ship fast, get user feedback, iterate. These are things that Y Combinator teaches that OpenAI also deeply believes in. And under Sam's leadership, Y Combinator became one of the most influential institutions in the valley. It launched Airbnb, launched Dropbox, it launched Reddit. It trained a generation of founders to think in terms of velocity and scale. Arguably, it wrote the book on entrepreneurship in the valley. And so when Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015 and later became CEO, he brought that worldview with him. Move fast, ship experiments, capture market share, learn from users at scale. Are you seeing the difference here? Daario is a scientist who became an entrepreneur. the instinct to understand before deploying to understand how the value that you build actually shapes the world around you and Sam as an entrepreneur who became a tech leader the instinct to deploy in order to understand to actually learn directly from users to just ship it. I'm not trying to make a case that either of these orientations is wrong. I think that's an impoverished view. I'm making the case that they're different theories of how progress happens and they lead to radically different organizations. And because of this moment in time, these two leaders and their different philosophies are actually shaping the future of artificial intelligence and the way we will all work. It is worth understanding the way they think and it is worth considering where they are taking their companies as a result. And that's what we'll get to at the end of this video. I do want to spend a moment talking about the different theories of safety that these leaders have because I think it's widely misunderstood. Most AI coverage gets this wrong. I believe the standard narrative is that some companies care about safety and some do not. I think that's incorrect. Open AI ships fast because they're reckless goes the prevailing narrative. Anthropic ship slow because they're cautious goes the prevailing narrative. Let's not read it that way. Both Sam and Daario believe AI safety is critically important. But they have very different theories about how you achieve it. Sam believes that safety emerges from deployment. And that's not negligence dressed up as strategy. It's a coherent philosophy and it comes directly from YC training. At YC, you learn that you can theorize forever in the garage, but you won't actually understand your product until users interact with it. The market teaches you what you cannot learn otherwise. Real world feedback is a hundred a thousand times more valuable than any amount of internal testing. And Sam has applied this exact framework to AI safety. In his writing, he's been very explicit and I quote, \"The best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with technology.\" And at Davos, he expanded iterative development means that society can get used to the technology. let society and technology co-evolve and sort of step by step get there with a very tight feedback loop. That sounds like YC. In Sam's framework, the public is in a way a testing environment. And I don't want to suggest that they're not doing internal testing on these models. OpenAI does extensive internal testing on models before releasing it. They produce model cards listing safety features and the work they've done to test it. And they've got a whole safety framework in place. So don't read this larger philosophical statement as saying they don't think about safety before model release because that would be incorrect. But once teams have tested, once the model is deemed safe enough to release, after that they do collect feedback from users and obsessively iterate to improve the product. As millions of users discover problems and report them, OpenAI fixes them. I think the launch of chat GPT health is a good example of this as they have seen the way users have interacted with chat GPT around health matters. They have listened to feedback, iterated and launched a dedicated product that allows you in a secure environment to upload your records and chat with chat GPT. In other words, they took what users were already doing, went through the pain points with the existing chat GPT process and shipped something quickly. This is Weiss's core lesson applied to the most important technology in human history. You learn what's safe by deploying, not just by theorizing. But Daario believes the opposite. For Daario, safety is a precondition for deployment, not something that emerges from it. You understand before you release. You demonstrate safety affirmatively before scaling. This is the company that invented constitutional AI. You don't treat the public as your red team. You treat them as people who deserve to know the system works before you put it in their hands. In his essay, Machines of Love and Grace, Daario articulated something really critical. The basic development of AI technology and many of its benefits seems inevitable and is fundamentally driven by powerful market forces and the risks are not predetermined. This is an argument about leverage, right? The market will handle the benefits automatically. According to Daario, companies will automatically compete to make AI more useful. the market will do its job and doesn't need advocates per Dario. But the risks, that's where Daario says they require active intervention. Those require someone who can pump the brakes to insist on understanding before deployment. And that's where focused effort actually changes outcomes and that's part of where he sees anthropic's role. This is why Anthropic built AI safety levels modeled on biosafety levels for handling pathogens. At ASL3, for example, systems can meaningfully assist in creating bioweapons, and Anthropic would have to commit to demonstrating no meaningful catastrophic misuse risk before deployment. In other words, the standard is not we tested it and didn't find any problems. It we can prove it's safe. And if scaling outpaces their ability to ensure safety, Anthropic is very clear saying they're willing to pause training. They're willing to slow down, they're not going to be in a rush about it. Compare this to what happened at OpenAI when Google launched Gemini. Sam reportedly declared Code Red and accelerated the release of Chat GPT 5.2, pushing the launch forward in one of OpenAI's fastest turnarounds ever. When competitive pressure hits, OpenAI has a history of speeding up. Enthropic has committed with governance structures to enforce it to potentially slow down. These are different epistemologies. These are entirely different ways of seeing the world. And here's something most people don't know. Mario joined OpenAI in 2016 as a vice president of research. He helped write OpenAI's original charter. For four years, he played a central role in building GPT2 and GPT3. Ultimately, he left to found Anthropic because he believed in a different vision that was more in line with his long-term perspective that we need to derisk AI before launching into the world. So, Enthropic is not Dario's first attempt at building an AI safety company. It's actually his second and he's learned from that and that's why he built Anthropic with the checks and balances he did to make governance crisis easier to manage in an age where AI incentives are very powerful. One of the things I find most interesting about this whole conversation is that the product visions of these companies reflect this perspective on safety and experimentation. Anthropic has bet that intelligence is a vertical, a specialty that certain customers will pay enormous premiums for. And so they decided to strip distractions away. No video generation from Anthropic, no image generation from Anthropic, no companion chatbot in the way that Gemini and Chat GPT are seeking to be companionable. They poured everything into reasoning density, into code reliability, into interpretability, into reducing hallucination and complex domains, into tool use. And that paid off because by 2026 has become the core operating system for much cognitive labor among the professional classes. If a lawyer can't afford hallucinated citations, so often they turn to Claude. If the developer has to write production code, they turn to Claude. If an analyst has to synthesize market intelligence, you guessed it, they turn to Claude. Ironically, by betting on code as a way to manipulate computing and making sure that they got that right through Claude code, through the chatbot, more recently through the extension in Chrome. What Daario has done is create the closest thing we've seen to a generalpurpose agent to help professionals do their work more effectively. That focus is what paid off in the tremendous boom in claude code usage that we saw in the last month of 2025 and into January 2026. Now, OpenAI has bet the opposite. The idea of experimentation of YC like fast shipping has translated into a culture where you're encouraged to ship your experiments. And so, fundamentally, the philosophy I see is that OpenAI sees intelligence as a horizontal interface that touches absolutely everything in human life. And so AI is treated sort of like a consumer super app. Sora for video, chat GPT health for medical consultation. There's a search integration. Voice is now there. We have image generation in chat GPT. There's a browser. Chat GPT isn't really a chatbot. It's a doctor. It's a filmmaker. It's a search engine. It's a coding assistant. It's it's everything. It's a life flare. And I believe this very intentionally goes back to the way the company thinks, the way Sam thinks about launching, which is that you launch, you see what works and you double down. It's it's as if OpenAI is incubating a series of Y Combinator companies inside itself and they're going to try and see what works and then scale what works well and not scale what doesn't work well. I believe that if you look at these two product visions, what you're going to see is that we're no longer in one AI economy. This is such a big revolution. I am not interested in picking sides. I am not interested in picking winners. It is a big enough world where everybody is going to win in AI. We're no longer in one AI economy. We're in at least two operating under very different rules. Economy one is focused on extremely rapid generation of abundant intelligence. If your work involves producing outputs, content, media, drafts, creative exploration, and yes, code through codecs, you live in OpenAI's world. They're driving marginal cost towards zero. Sora means that video that costs thousands takes a few minutes. Now, chat GPT health means you can triage at the kitchen table. And yes, they're producing tools that help you get Excel and Word docs done. And there's always the code review that you can do with codecs. And the strategic imperative for them is that you drive the chat GPT surface across as many facets of a user's life as you can in order to drive deep habitual adoption. And the market will handle the benefit and which ones win automatically. You're just trying to put as many shots on the board for adoption across different use cases in a user's life as you possibly can, as quickly as you can. I think that's the cleanest explanation I can see of the open AI strategy. Meanwhile, economy 2 is about managing complexity. This is very much a professional working environment, right? If your work involves exercising judgment, if it involves production code or legal analysis or high stakes decisions or anything where errors are expensive, you often are living in anthropics world. Claude doesn't replace the expert, but it does amplify, it does augment them. It becomes a bicycle for the mind of the expert. And so the strategic imperative there is adoption quality. How do you learn to collaborate with AI while enhancing and preserving your judgment? That's a lot of the secret sauce in the claude experience. You see how these are very different. It's not even the same user at this point. One thing I will call out where both companies are playing and I think differences are misunderstood. Codeex versus clawed code, I would argue, are also not as directly competing as people like to think because of the focus of anthropic on using code as a tool that allows you to do anything across the computing ecosystem. Claude code has effectively become, as I mentioned earlier in the video, the first generalpurpose agent. At the same time, Codeex has been obsessed with code quality, especially at scale. Codeex is not as fast at cloud code at many problems, but OpenAI has bet through their deep interaction YC style with engineers and users, including engineers at at OpenAI who use it all the time, that you need to ship correct code in order to build something useful. And that if you take a little bit longer, but you have a higher confidence in correctness, it's going to be worth it. And Codeex is renowned for high quality code reviews, for finding bugs. People will still say, \"Put your Claude Code code into Codeex for a review and you'll benefit.\" And what I see is a just strikingly different vision of where engineers are going to be spending their time. Are you going to be spending your time planning really carefully and then thoughtfully giving a problem to codeex to chew on? or are you going to be more iterative and give work to Claude code or maybe even have Claude code interview you discover the parameters of the work and then focus your agent on the agreed direction. These are different visions for how we allocate our time in the future and I think that code is becoming one of the first places where we see the direct impact on our time and our work from these divergent companies and company strategies. In 2026, I would love it if we stopped asking which AI is better and started asking what work are we doing with AI and what's useful. Stop being so competitive, right? I think Sam built something that I would describe as an engine of abundance, right? Intelligence everywhere, safety emerging from deployment, millions of users who are using the product and giving useful feedback on a daily basis. And all of that YC training and launch instincts are leading to chat GPT becoming a super app for hundreds of millions of people. Daario built a precise lever for judgment. It's like the intelligence is deep before it became broad. And he is focused on bending the arc of the artificial intelligence universe towards systems that have a deep coherence within themselves. systems that have integrity, systems that have structure, and yes, an AI that has a moral core. And so everything he's done has led to Claude becoming the operating system for very high stakes work, not just coding work, but knowledge work in general, legal work comes to mind. Work that involves creating board decks, anything that has to be precise and correct. Now, both believe AI can be transformative. both believe safety matters. But these fundamentally different approaches to how they think about artificial intelligence, how you achieve safety in the world, how you should operate a company that is launching high consequence intelligence, how you balance speed and caution. These are shaping our whole world. I think the general intelligence race is something that the press likes to talk about, but more and more these days, I think it's an unhelpful characterization. The same thing happened with the automobile market. We talked about which car was best when cars were first launched. We talked about whether Apple and Windows were best when Apple and Windows were in a war in the '90s. But as we grew up, as the market matured, which is best became meaningless because the products differentiated to serve different needs. We are getting there faster with AI because everything is faster with AI. If you are into a world where you need to touch everything and have the whole ecosystem make sense and talk to itself and generate a lot a lot a lot across many different media and forms, you're probably in Sam Alman's world. If you're in a world where you're managing complexity and it's very high judgment and you have to amplify your thinking, you're often in Daario's world. And I know that many of us are in both. And that's why I keep emphasizing I don't think there's only one winner here. But I think it's worth understanding the different philosophies because they're going to shape the kinds of products we get. You should not expect Claude to come out with an image generator very soon. You should not expect a video generator. Claude is a focused company. Claude is going to keep shipping extraordinarily extraordinary tool calling agents. On the other hand, you should expect OpenAI to keep experimenting aggressively. I expect an OpenAI produced film to be in the race for an animation award in the next couple of years. They are going to keep pushing the boundaries wherever they can find them because that is what they do as a company. They try and experiment. They try and drive. They try and get feedback rapidly and they try and evolve. You should expect the same thing as they play in the education space, uh the same thing in the health space. and they're just going to keep shipping because effectively they're the Y combinator of AI. I hope this video has given you a sense of how the leadership at these two companies is shaping the culture, the strategy, and ultimately the AI that more than a billion of us are already touching every day. I think it's worth understanding the differences, and I think it's worth understanding how those differences shape what we can expect in the next year. I'm curious which do you lean toward open AI or or anthropic?",
