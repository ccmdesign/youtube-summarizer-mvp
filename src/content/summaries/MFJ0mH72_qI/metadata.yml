title: ShadCN is Way too Powerful Now
description: >-
  Building with shadcn ui can break your apps during vibe coding sessions. Learn
  how context engineering with cursor ai and claude code creates reliable
  agentic workflows that actually complete your tasks autonomously.



  In this video, I break down one of the biggest challenges in ai coding
  today—getting AI agents to finish complex UI implementations without breaking
  other parts of your app. If you're looking for the best ai for coding
  workflows, especially with component libraries, this is for you.


  I walk through how Anthropic's Ralph loop plugin works with claude code to
  create an ai coding workflow that doesn't quit halfway through. This is a
  claude code tutorial where you'll learn real claude code skills like
  implementing test-driven development (TDD) with Playwright for automated
  screenshot verification.


  We compare different approaches to ai ide coding, showing why combining
  agentic loops with proper testing beats traditional methods. Whether you're
  coding for beginners or an experienced developer exploring coding with ai,
  you'll see exactly how to set this up.


  The video covers building a command palette and Kanban board feature,
  demonstrating programming concepts, artificial intelligence applications in
  software engineering, and how to debug when your ai agent outputs premature
  completion promises.


  You'll learn how to use claude code with specific prompts that prevent early
  task abandonment—making it superior to basic implementations. This isn't just
  about claude code vs cursor or cursor vs claude code debates. It's about
  understanding how claude code agents work and leveraging agentic ai patterns
  with mcp server integrations and ai tools to build reliable applications.


  Whether you use chatgpt, openai models, or Claude, these principles apply to
  any ai agent workflow.
