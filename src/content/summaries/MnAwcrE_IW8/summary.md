  A nutrient-dense, **flowerless bread** made from **ground flax and chia seeds**.
  - **Grain-free base**: Uses 150g flax seeds and 2 tbsp chia seeds for a high-fiber, omega-3-rich loaf.
  - **Natural Binding**: Relies on seed mucilage instead of oil or eggs.
  - **Baking**: Bake at **350°F for 60-70 minutes** after a 15-minute rest to ensure the structure sets properly.

## Key Takeaways

This recipe demonstrates how to create a structural bread loaf using nutrient-dense seeds instead of traditional grains or starches.

- **Seed Mucilage as Binder**: Chia and flax seeds act as a natural sponge, absorbing water to create a "gel" that binds the loaf without gluten, oil, or eggs.

- **Nutritional Density**: The bread is packed with **Omega-3 fatty acids**, **lignans**, and **fiber**, promoting heart health and prolonged satiety.

- **Crucial Resting Phase**: Allowing the dough to rest for 15 minutes is essential for the seeds to absorb moisture and firm up into a shapeable dough.

- **Toasting for Flavor**: Pre-toasting the sunflower seeds adds a depth of flavor and crunch that balances the earthy flax base.

## Summary

### The Power of Seed-Based Baking
This recipe replaces traditional flour with **freshly ground flax seeds** and **chia seeds**. By grinding 150g of flax seeds into a fine powder, you release essential nutrients like omega-3s and lignans. Unlike wheat flour, flax is highly absorbent, acting like a natural sponge to create a moist, structured crumb without the need for gluten or processed starches.

### Preparation and Binding
The binding process relies on two key steps:

- **Chia Gel**: Soaking 2 tablespoons of chia seeds in water creates a thick gel that provides "bounce" and elasticity to the dough, replacing the role of eggs.

- **Hydration and Resting**: Mixing the flax meal with 200ml of water and the chia gel creates a sticky dough. Allowing the mixture to **rest for 15 minutes** is the most critical step; it lets the seeds fully hydrate and the dough firm up so it can be shaped by hand.

### Flavor and Texture Enhancements
To ensure the bread has a satisfying texture, 50g of **toasted sunflower seeds** are folded into the dough. This adds crunch and a warm, nutty aroma. Before baking, the recipe calls for a teaspoon of **apple cider vinegar** to be spread over the loaf. This interacts with the baking powder to assist with leavening, while a topping of sesame seeds provides a professional, crusty finish.

### Baking and Serving
The loaf requires a slow bake at **350°F (175°C)** for approximately 60 to 70 minutes. This long duration ensures the center sets thoroughly without burning the exterior. Once cooled, the bread offers a hearty, earthy flavor profile. The video also suggests pairing the loaf with a tangy **Greek yogurt dip** made with sorrel, garlic, and lemon juice to complement the rich nuttiness of the seeds. This result is a vegan, gluten-free bread that provides steady energy without the blood sugar spikes associated with white flour.

## Context

This recipe addresses the growing demand for **grain-free** and **nutrient-dense** alternatives to traditional bread. As consumers become more aware of gut health, gluten sensitivities, and the metabolic impact of refined carbohydrates, "functional breads" made from whole seeds have gained popularity. This method is particularly significant for those following **Keto, Paleo, or Vegan** diets, as it avoids common allergens like eggs and soy. It connects to the broader trend of "clean eating" by proving that bread—a dietary staple—can be transformed from a high-carb filler into a superfood-rich source of healthy fats and fiber.
