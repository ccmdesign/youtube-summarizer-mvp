  "fullText": "Add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds into a small bowl. Pour in four tablespoons of water. Give it a gentle stir and set it aside. By the way, I'd love to know where are you watching from. Drop your country's name or flag in the comments. While that thickens, measure 150 g of flax seeds. Blend them into a fine soft powder. Ground flax seeds bring in that subtle nutty flavor that makes the dough smell warm and earthy. When you grind them fresh, they release all their omega-3 goodness. Those healthy fats that keep your heart strong and your brain sharp. They're also packed with lignens and fiber, which help balance hormones, support digestion, and keep you feeling full for longer. It's one of those quiet superfoods, simple, natural, and so good for your body inside and out. That gentle nuttiness will give your bread a rich flavor and a soft, moist texture without needing any flour or oil. Add one teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt. Mix everything well.

Now, pour in 3/4 cup, about 200 ml, of water. Stir until it starts forming a smooth, sticky dough. When you grind flax seeds, something really cool happens. They turn into this natural magic powder that loves water. The moment you mix it in, it starts soaking up all the liquid and thickens into a soft, sticky dough. That's because flax is full of natural fiber that acts like a sponge. It holds everything together, keeps the bread moist, and gives it that perfect texture. No flour, no eggs, just the power of seeds doing their thing. Now add the chia gel. That chia gel brings everything together, gives the dough a nice bounce, and helps it stay soft and moist inside. They might look small, but chia seeds are powerhouse ingredients. Soothing for digestion and amazing for sustained energy. Look how it thickens naturally without any flour or eggs. Next, toast 50 g of sunflower seeds in a dry pan. Keep them moving until they turn golden and release that warm, nutty aroma. Add the toasted sunflower seeds to the mixture. Give it a gentle stir so they spread evenly through the dough. Now set it aside and let it rest for about 15 minutes. During this time, the seeds absorb moisture and the dough starts to firm up beautifully. Line your baking dish with parchment paper. Lightly brush it with oil, making sure to cover the sides as well. You'll notice the texture becoming thicker and easier to shape. That's exactly what we want. Now, take the dough and form it into a smooth ball. Make sure the surface looks even and neat. Drizzle one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar over the top and spread it evenly. After that, place the shaped dough into your prepared dish. Sprinkle a bit of sesame on top for that final touch. Bake in a preheated oven at 350° F for about 60 to 70 minutes until the crust turns golden and your kitchen smells incredible. While it bakes, let's make a quick fresh dip. Add 2 tablespoon of Greek yogurt into a bowl. Finally, chop a few leaves of sorrel, spinach, or some spring onions. and and mix them in. Add one tablespoon of olive oil, a teaspoon of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and one crushed clove of garlic. Stir until creamy and smooth. It's tangy, refreshing, and full of good fats. Now, back to our bread. Look at that. Golden on top, firm on the outside, and soft inside. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. So, here it is.
