title: AI, Knowledge Management, and Vibe Coding | A Proof of Concept for
  Educational Leaders
description: >-
  I'm a 30-year veteran of public education. We're all in a tizzy, of course,
  about how AI is changing our profession right before our eyes. But an excited
  tizzy, for many of us. AI has a lot of potential to reinvent schooling, to be
  sure, but the real magic--and perhaps the real purpose--is in what we've
  always done in schools. That is, we've always worked to prepare students to be
  collaborative, thoughtful, contributing adults. If we focus, as schools, on
  using AI for that--empowering adult collaboration rather than just making
  quizzes or generating text sets--then we'll model the best uses of this crazy
  technology.


  In this video, I talk about how I'm using AI to help me manage information. In
  short, I've vibe coded an Obsidian plugin to help me visualize my knowledge
  base. Yes ... I've used AI to write computer code to use AI to help me with my
  voluminous notes.


  I'll share more on how I made this all happen in a later video.
