  "fullText": "Charging low prices is destroying your startup. And yet founders believe raising prices means losing all their customers. Wrong. You'll only lose the wrong ones. Think of pricing like a thermometer with three critical levels. At the bottom is the minimum cost to deliver your product. In the middle is the actual price you charge. At the top is what customers think it's worth. The gap between your price and the value to the customer is their incentive to buy. The bigger this gap, the faster they say yes. Because nobody buys on price alone. They buy when the value feels absolutely undeniable. But the problem is, if you build something 10 times better, but charge half the price, they'll assume something's fundamentally broken because too good to be true kills more startups than too expensive ever will. Yet founders keep falling into the garbage zone, charging anywhere between $2,000 and $25,000 per year with sales cycles that drag on for months, making you too cheap for enterprise and too costly for self-s serve. So, how do you fix this? Start by pricing at onetenth of the value you create. Then raise prices by 5% until you're losing exactly 20% of your customers. After that, you can track these three metrics to make sure your customers are paying what you're actually",
