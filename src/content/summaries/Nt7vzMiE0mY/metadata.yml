  _______________________
  What's really happening with AI image generation in the enterprise? The common story is that tools like Nano Banana Pro are for designers and marketers — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on why visual AI is infrastructure, not a creative tool:

   • Why the invisible fence around AI has been visual interpretation
   • How the closed loop changes workflows that broke at visual touchpoints
   • What separates 30% organizations from 300% organizations
   • Where visual AI creates real leverage beyond the design department

  A billion images generated in 53 days is not a story about artistic quality. It's about what happens when AI systems can finally see and show. Customer support can interpret screenshots. Product teams can receive visual triage reports. Documentation can update itself. The automation chains that broke at visual links can now run continuously.

  For leaders assessing AI investments, the window of first-mover advantage is open — but treating visual AI as a department tool will only capture point solution value.
