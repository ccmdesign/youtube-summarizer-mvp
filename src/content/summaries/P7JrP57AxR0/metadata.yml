title: Claude Code Can Now Control Your Browser (Thanks to Vercel)
description: >-
  Agent Browser is a headless browser automation CLI that Vercel developed for
  AI agents (like Claude Code), created by Chris Tate in just a single weekend. 


  This powerful tool combines a fast Rust CLI with Node.js to give AI agents
  complete control over web browsers through simple commands like open, click,
  fill, and snapshot, all with a unique ref-based system that makes element
  selection deterministic and AI-friendly. With support for multiple browser
  engines, session management, and seamless integration into existing AI
  workflows, Agent Browser provides a robust solution for web automation that
  works perfectly with tools like Claude Code and other AI agents.
