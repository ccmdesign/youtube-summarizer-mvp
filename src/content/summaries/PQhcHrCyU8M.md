  Main insight here:
  - **AI agents are collapsing traditional software silos** by enabling designers and PMs to interact directly with the codebase, the "ultimate truth" of software.
  - **Human 'taste' serves as the filter** that prevents "AI slop" by providing opinionated selection and boundaries for the model's output.
  - **Universal interfaces** like Cursor are shifting the focus from specialized t

## Key Takeaways

Ryo Lu explores the transition from a fragmented software development cycle to a unified era where AI removes technical barriers between ideation and execution. He emphasizes that while AI can handle the baseline of creation, the human role remains critical in providing conceptual clarity and aesthetic direction.

* **The Reunification of Roles:** The last 15 years of software development were defined by fragmentation (designers in Figma, PMs in docs, engineers in IDEs). AI tools like Cursor are reuniting these into a single workflow centered on the codebase.

* **Code as the Shared Truth:** Rather than translating mocks through meetings and PRDs, designers can now use AI to manipulate the actual code, ensuring the shipped product matches the original intent.

* **Defining Taste vs. AI Slop:** Taste is described as the act of **self-selecting boundaries** and drawing from a library of past connections. Without human opinion, AI produces generic "slop."
* **Conceptual Design over Aesthetics:** True design is about architectural simplicity—reducing the number of concepts and code paths—rather than just UI elements like border radii.

* **Adaptive UX:** The future of AI interaction moves beyond the "blank chat box" toward context-aware interfaces that adapt to the user's specific workflow (e.g., autocompletes, artboard variants).

## Summary

### The Collapse of Software Fragmentation
Ryo Lu discusses how the art of software creation has become increasingly fragmented over the last 15 years. Roles have been split into silos—designers, product managers, and engineers—each using their own specific tools and languages. This fragmentation created a massive "translation tax," where a designer's mock in Figma might take a year to reach production, often losing 80% of its original intent along the way. With the advent of AI agents and tools like **Cursor**, Lu argues we are entering a phase where these boundaries are dissolving. A designer can now prompt an agent to build a functional prototype that is 60-70% complete on the first shot, effectively skipping the traditional complexities of manual implementation.

This shift moves the industry back toward the "early computing era," where the first software makers were holistic researchers who handled everything from low-level architecture to UI design. AI acts as a **universal interface**, allowing individuals to cover their technical weaknesses and amplify their strengths. Lu suggests that we should stop thinking of ourselves as "product designers" or "front-end engineers" and start identifying as "software makers" who use AI to bridge the gaps in our skill sets.

### The Shared Truth of the Codebase
Lu emphasizes that the **codebase is the ultimate material and truth** of software. In the traditional workflow, PMs influence the code through passive organizational documents, and designers influence it through visual mocks. However, both are disconnected from the actual material. By bringing designers and PMs into the IDE through AI, everyone begins to work on the same artifact. This prevents the "shipping your org chart" phenomenon, where disjointed team structures lead to fragmented, complex software.

Cursor is designed to absorb various artifacts—Figma mocks, meeting notes, and documentation—and synthesize them into code. This allows for a "feedback loop" that is significantly faster than traditional methods. When a designer can poke at a functional artifact rather than a static image, the iteration process becomes visceral and immediate. The agent knows the present (the codebase), the past (the team's preferences), and the future (the vision), allowing it to act as a cohesive force for the entire team.

### Redefining Taste and Opinion
A central theme of the conversation is the concept of **taste**. Lu rejects the idea that taste is an ambiguous "vibe." Instead, he defines it as a rigorous process of selection and boundary-setting. Because an LLM has seen "everything," it lacks an inherent opinion and often defaults to generic trends (like purple gradients). The human's role is to provide the "opinion" that prevents the output from becoming **AI slop**. 

He introduces Cursor's **Plan Mode** as an example of this human-AI partnership. The agent can build a specification, but the human must add the details and the "why" behind the choices. If a user provides a non-specific prompt, they will get a non-specific result. Therefore, the most valuable skill in an AI-driven world is the ability to specify exactly what is "good" or "right" for a specific context, drawing from a deep well of personal and historical inspiration.

### Systems Thinking and the Future of UI
Lu shares his design philosophy, heavily influenced by his time at **Notion**. He argues that great design is not about aesthetic flourishes but about **conceptual simplicity**. Notion succeeded because it was a pure conceptual product—built on blocks, pages, and databases—where every layer of the software reflected those core concepts. This systems-thinking approach is what Lu brings to Cursor. He aims to create a tool that is simple at its core but can be mutated to fit different archetypes.

Looking forward, Lu envisions software that moves beyond the **chat box**. While the chat box is a universal starting point, it can be intimidating. The future of UX lies in adaptive layers. For a designer, the AI might manifest as an artboard with variants; for an engineer, as a sophisticated code editor; and for a PM, as a structured document. The underlying engine—the AI agent—remains the same, but the representation shifts to suit the user's "power user" needs while keeping the default experience simple. This "toolbox" approach allows users to customize their own environment, as seen in Lu's **Rio OS** project, which explores how timeless UI concepts from 1984 can still feel authentic and functional today.

## Context

Ryo Lu is the Head of Design at Cursor (Anysphere) and was previously a key design leader at Notion and Asana. He is widely recognized for his "systems-first" approach to design and his ability to build tools that empower users to create complex systems. This conversation, hosted by Jennifer Li from a16z, comes at a pivotal moment when AI-native development tools are challenging the traditional boundaries between technical and non-technical roles. This video is essential for designers who feel threatened by AI, as Lu reframes the technology as a tool for creative empowerment rather than replacement. It also provides deep insights for founders and product leaders on building "universal" vs. "purpose-built" tools in the age of generative agents. As Cursor becomes the dominant IDE for AI-assisted coding, Lu's vision of a unified "software maker" role serves as a blueprint for the future of the tech workforce.
