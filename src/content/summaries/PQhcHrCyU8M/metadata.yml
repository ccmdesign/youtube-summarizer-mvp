title: "Ryo Lu (Cursor): AI Turns Designers to Developers"
description: >-
  Ryo Lu spent years watching his designs die in meetings. Then he discovered
  the tool that lets designers ship code at the speed of thought: Cursor, the
  company where Ryo is now Head of Design. In this episode, a16z General Partner
  Jennifer Li sits down with Ryo to discuss why "taste" is the wrong framework
  for understanding the future, why purposeful apps are "selfish," how System 7
  holds secrets about AI interfaces, and the radical bet that one codebase can
  serve everyone if you design the concepts right instead of the buttons.
