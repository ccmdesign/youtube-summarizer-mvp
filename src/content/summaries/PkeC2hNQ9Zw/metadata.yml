title: How I Made Claude Code WAY Better With Vercel Agent Skills
description: |-
  The AI development landscape just got turned upside down. Vercel's new Agent Skills ecosystem is fundamentally changing how we work with Claude Code and other coding agents. The skills CLI tool let's you install skills with a single command, and the skills.sh marketplace let's you discover skills. But Cloudflare just dropped a competing RFC proposing (Agent Skills Discovery via Well-Known URIs) a completely different approach using .well-known URIs that could make Vercel's entire centralized directory model obsolete.
