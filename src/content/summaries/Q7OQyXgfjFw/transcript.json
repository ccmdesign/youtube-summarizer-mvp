I'm talking about what I actually see on X, on Reddit, other places with screenshots, with videos. People are using the API call to pass a string of data in a structured prompt query to NanoBanana Pro and retrieve a chart or a graph that they can then display as the past week's sales, the past days customers, whatever it is that they need for internal metrics, they can just automatically query and get a nice chart back from Nano Banana Pro. That is generative interface driven by Aentic software. Fundamentally, the interface is something that is starting to morph based on user context and it isn't staying fixed anymore. Software is becoming generated on demand from intent and context. It's becoming private to the user in the moment for that particular ask. It's becoming discarded when that moment passes.",
