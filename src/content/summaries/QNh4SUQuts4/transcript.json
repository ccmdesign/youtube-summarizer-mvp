  "fullText": "Today we're going to test how good of a designer is Gemini 3.0 within Google AI Studio. So we're going to actually design a personal website. We're going to design a SAS app. We're going to design a mobile app. And we're going to find out by the end of this episode how awesome is it. Is it a 6 on 10? Is it an 8 on 10? Is it a 10 on 10? And to be honest, the only exposure I had to using Gemini 3.0 O and Google AI Studio was in the episode I did the other day with Logan Kilpatrick from the DeepMind team. It did a pretty good job at it. Actually, a very good job at it. And I wanted to go deeper and do an episode where we just kind of see, okay, you know, can can this thing go the extra mile. So, we're going to do it together and we're going to find out how good it is. [music] So, let's start off by designing a personal website. So, I actually have a personal website. Um, but I think it could be a lot more, let's put it, you know, nicer. I think it could be a bit a bit nicer. It's just quite basic. So, I'm going to go ahead and copy uh copy uh the screenshot. Um, I go to build over here. And this is where you're going to go and design or build your ideas. So you can use this to vibe code or you can use this to be a vibe designing. So you you can see here that I've selected the Gemini 3 uh pro um model and I'm going to say I have a personal web page, but I think it's not that well designed or could be better. I've attached a screenshot of what it looks like, but I want you to design this with more color, more freshness, and more and just all around more interesting. Maybe you can make it a full experience somehow. Not giving it a lot of uh I'm not giving it a lot of instructions. [snorts] I kind of want to see like what it does. I could be could maybe say like, hey, I want it to be like Microsoft XP designed or something like that. Actually, it's probably a good idea. Let's make it look like a 3D experience. Microsoft XP. Actually, not 3D experience. Let's make it look like an experience in Microsoft XP except it's a personal website. Um, the website domain is gregisenberg.com if you want to grab content from there. Okay. So I've gone ahead and given it a prompt and now you can see Gemini 3 Pro Pro preview is running. This is cool that you'll see that it it does you know on on AI Studio and Gemini 3 you kind of see it shows its work. Um so it'll say like you know what it's doing. Um so you can see here it's actually creating the metadata.json the index.html. Um and you can I think yeah hover over it and you can see what what is happening. So it's using Tailwind CSS uh React application entry point. Um and by the way I have no affiliation with Google. I do think that they are absolutely crushing it lately. Um and I think in 2026 um they will continue to crush it. So, I am bullish on them and that's why I really want to get to use their products more and more because uh I'm just seeing that, you know, them just do a great job at uh you know, think about where they were 12, 18 months ago. They were literally building Google Bard. You know, they went from Google Bard, lamest name, to you know, their cursor competitor is called Ultragravity. Way cooler, right? So, you could just see that they're they're taking a lot more seriously. And I think that it's really going to be, you know, it's it's it's Google AI versus code versus uh chat GBT. And I wouldn't be surprised if Google AI wins. So, it's uh still creating um it's still creating the uh the app. Uh we can go ahead on just a look at like what I currently have. It's uh it's just pretty simple website. It it it does the job. It it shares, you know, a link to subscribe to my newsletter. It gives different guides that people can download. Uh it links to this uh startup ideas podcast on Spotify and YouTube. It shows here's all my portfolio companies and all the companies I'm working on and that's basically it. Um there's a about me and there is an a blog there is a blog. So it's a very simple website and I'm curious um you know can can Google AI Gemini 3.0 Oh, actually build something that doesn't feel like a purple vibeccoated app that feels just a lot better. Something that I would like, you know, update update this too. Sam Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI just said that it is the era of the idea guy and he is not wrong. I think that right now is an incredible time to be building a startup and if you listen to this podcast, chances are you think so, too. Now, I think that you can look at trends uh to basically figure out uh what are the startup ideas you should be building. So, that's exactly why I built ideabrowser.com. Every single day, you're going to get a free startup idea in your inbox and it's all backed by highquality data trends. How we do it, people always ask. We use AI agents to go and search what are people looking for and what are they screaming for in terms of products that you should be building and then we hand it on a, you know, silver platter for you to go check out. Um, we do have a few paid plans that, you know, take it to the next level, uh, give you more ideas, give you more AI agents and more almost like a chatgbt for ideas with it. But you can start for free ideabrows.com. And if you're listening to this, I highly recommend it. Okay, so stuff is happening. So, uh Oh my god. Okay, so here we are. [sighs] This [laughter] is This is This is crazy. So, we're looking here. It doesn't put uh Windows, right? Cuz it's probably a copyright thing, but it looks like Windows. It looks like Windows XP. Um it's the notepad is over here. uh where it says like Greg Eisberg, the internet is my playground. I kind of love that tagline. Um it's taken the um it's taken the copy from from my website already. Uh you can see it has the links over here and then it's gone and created some like different you know applications. So there's the about uh Greg application, Greg's letter which is my newsletter where I guess people can subscribe to. Um and then they have the different guides. So, I just go went in ahead and clicked on guides. You can see like look at this. This is this is a website. This is crazy. How does this even there's no way this works on mobile, right? Yeah. Well, actually works on mobile, surprisingly. Uh so, you know, f it has all my guides. It shows PDF and blueprint. The icons look really, really good. These guide, it says details. These guides are created based on real world real world experience building link checkout size very high value date modified today. This is like I don't know about you but to me this is like really really awesome. Um I'm just going to say let's just try to edit it a little bit. I noticed there are no icons for the applications like idea generator or internet. Actually, it's not it's not that there's no icons. It's just that the icons aren't hitting right. the icons that you chose for the applications like about Greg and Greg's letter, etc., they don't feel like real Windows or Mac app icons. Please make them more real. And let's see what happens. And the reason I'm I I I want to see like can this thing design well, right? like um you know, can it take feedback? Well, uh that was what one of the things that I was really impressed with in my chat with Logan Kilpatrick. Um and if you haven't seen that episode, we'll include it in the show notes in the description is how well it was able to take feedback. So, let's just see uh if a non- Googleler like myself actually can get, you know, similar similar and good results. The other thing that I want to I want to ask to change is I do find like the white background to be uh I don't know boring. So I'm going to say I find the white background. Oh actually what's this? What happens if I click this? Right. So you can So there's a button here that's annotation. So add annotations to visually iterate on your app. So, it says, \"Draw and write on your app preview to instantly communicate your vision to Gemini.\" Yes. So, Logan was showing me this. You can highlight components, sketch new ideas, or add precise feedback right where it matters. Simply pass your visual prompts to Gemini and watch your app update live. So, let's actually try to we'll let this think um and and update this. And then after that, let's go and annotate the background. Try to get it to a place where it looks a little bit better. And then once we're done that we will move on to can we design a SAS app. I know a lot of people listening you know want want to build a SAS app want to build a micro SAS love the idea of doing that. Um but you know when they use platforms like lovable or or other ones they or you know Replet or any any vibe coding platform they're just getting designs that uh are not are not uh not what they want uh not what they're not what's in their head really that's what it comes down to. I will say that uh Replet uh now has goo uh Google Gemini 3.0 Oh uh available um on uh I think it's available as of today. Let's check Gemini 3.0. Yeah, design mode. So they do have a new design mode to go from idea to a live website. Um and that's also powered by Gemini 3.0. So they've gone ahead and updated the icons. This is what I'm talking about. I don't know about you. Uh it did bug out here uh with popular guides, but every other icon was done to perfection in my opinion. This looks really really good. We're going to do the annotation quickly and I'm going to say, oh wow, it's like actually here add to you can see at the bottom once you click you can add a comment, you can add an arrow, rectangle. So, I'm going to go ahead and say um I'm going to say uh this white background is boring and doesn't give off Microsoft XP, the classic blue skies and and green mountain, please adjust. So, I just said, um, add this to chat. I'm going to send that to Gemini. And now it has that context. It's such a simple idea, right? They basically just made like a image editor within it. But it it makes it so much more um it's just you know this works best all all these platforms work best when you give it good references uh images. So um the more the better reference images you get you you generally get more out of it. So uh just FYI. So let's see um what what this does. And uh it's just crazy like it's really what's blowing my mind, what's going through my mind right now is it really is like if you have good ideas, if you have ideas that are scroll stopping, are interesting, um you can stand out, right? Like a personal website, everyone has a, you know, a lot of people have personal websites like mine, like just very simple about us, right? But they don't have a lot of people don't have something like this. And if you can stand out, maybe that gets you the, you know, the job you wanted. Maybe that gets you a client that you wouldn't have otherwise gotten. Um, you know, you never know, you know, what it's going to do. And, you know, we're all in this game of how do we increase our probability of success, right? How do we stack uh the chips in our favor? And good design really does that. You know, good design uh is viral. Good design is something that people talk about. Good design adds trust. So, um that's uh that's why you know you want you should want good design. So, it's it's uh it's been thinking for about one, you know, 110 seconds. Um let's uh let's give it a few more seconds and then move on to the SAS app. Taking like a little longer than I'd like you. It's kind of like surprising that uh you know the whole website was created in 111 seconds but the background is taken so far 136 seconds. [sighs] All right. So it broke the icons but you know I do think the having the background looks nicer. It didn't take my feedback around um it didn't take my feedback around creating the mountain. I think what I should have done is I should have just Googled like Microsoft XP background posted it into as a reference image and it probably would have worked. Um so I don't have time for it right now, but overall I don't know about you, but I'm pretty damn impressed. This exceeded my expectations on this uh personal website. nine on ten for me. Um I don't know about you, but I I'm probably going to be redoing my personal website soon. Next, let's go see how it does uh on designing a SAS app. So, right before this, I went on Dribble and I searched SAS app and uh dashboard, SAS dashboard, and this came up and I thought it looked like very clean. So, what I want to do is I want to go to I'm going to go back to the build section. Describe your idea. So, I'm going to add the reference image. Let's go ahead and do that. Copy. Going to add it right here. Uh, and I'm going to say this is a dashboard I really like. I'm building a software that is a analytics meets AI app for restaurants. I want it to be designed in a similar vibe. It's clean. It's modern. And I want the buttons to feel almost like real buttons in the real world. So just like simple language. There's like design terminology for this, but I'm just keeping it simple for everyone. Um knobs, etc. Can you make this happen? You know what? I'm going to actually pull up a I really like this company, Teenage. The designs are really nice. I just like their products. They do like audio and and microphones and stuff like that. I'm going to take a screenshot of this even though it's I mean this might just complicate things. Um, I also included a photo of a teenage engineering product that's physical that I imagine the buttons could be, you know, used on the SAS app. So, that doesn't even make that's not even good English, but let's just see what happens and see what it comes up with. In the past, you know what what the vibe coded SAS app would look like? It would look like the Tailwind CSS, like organized exactly how you think. Um, some purple, you know, and uh, you know, I I I'm hoping that this is a little more elevated. I'm hoping that this is a little more interesting. Um, I really didn't give it much data around like what are the product features and and stuff like that. Um, like you might have seen on the Logan Kilpatrick episode, um, you know, you could use something like ideabrowser.com if you're looking for a startup idea and you can just kind of take the startup idea and post it here and post it in uh, into the prompt. So you can go ahead and do that or if you have Idea Browser Pro, you can just, you know, grab the P, you know, product requirements doc, uh, which is also known as a PRD, and it gives you exactly what you would actually give a product manager, um, the whole prompt, and you can just copy this prompt, which is basically a product requirements doc, and just throw it into uh, Google AI Studio, or you can just build a uh, product requirements doc on whatever whatever it is you're working on. I think Lenny Richitzky has a PRD doc. Let's just see if he does. Yeah, my favorite product management templates. Um, so he linked it here. I can include it in the show notes, but basically a PRD means like what is the problem? What is the highle approach? What is the narrative? What are the goals? Ideally, you're giving this data to Google AI Studio so that you get the most the best design product that you know and and here we have here we have it. So, um that looks really nice. That looks really nice. Uh the buttons look really nice. They've got that Teenage Engineering vibe. Oh, come on. That is That is cool. That is That is Teenage Engineering. I'm not not really able to move it. Um, but it's created this AI analyst chef OS. Does this thing work? So, it basically created a AI helper. A OP restaurant is a fully operational and analyzing your data. Currently, we observe healthy, 14 active tables, average ticket. Like this is something that you might be able to like sell to a restaurant. Um, I think this looks super super super good. Um, it nice little animations here. Um, I like it. I like it a lot. Um, my only notes on here is this should be able to I should be able to move it. Oh, I can. You just have to click on it, but I should be able to drag and drop drag it just to make it easier. But like look at that. That looks sweet. So, um, overall, I would say I'm going to give this an 85. I don't know what you would give it. Um, you know, but, uh, I'm going to give it a quick 85. I mean, this is one prompt, one prompt. Let's go ahead and write that down. 8.5 on 10. The last thing uh, we're going to design is a mobile app. You know, a lot of you are interested in mobile apps and building mobile apps. Uh there's definitely a huge opportunity right now to build a mobile app with AI right now. I'm going to be doing a bunch of episodes on that, so stay tuned. Um I I want to get that out next week uh and the week after. But um you know, there's this app uh that my friend Yoni created. It's called Brain Rot and it's a basically an app that uh helps you get off Tik Tok and Instagram and and and basically anything that uh gets you to get your brain rot. So, it's created this little mascot and and it shows you your brain rotting in real time. Anyways, the point is let's just say we wanted to copy brain rot. So, let's go back to the build section and we're going to go and we're going to say we're going to copy here. Let's just copy this. So, I've gone and just copied the uh app store previews. And I don't know if Gemini 3.0 is good at designing mobile apps. So, that's what we're going to find out today. I want to design a mobile app. I really like everything about this app called Brain Rod. I'm even going to say by my friend Yonyi. The mascot, the gamification, everything about it feels to me like a blueprint for getting someone to do something. What if you designed the brain rot for getting people to [music] work out? Can you do it in the style of brain rot? Mascot warm colors. Um, beautifully designed. And I'm going to say make sure you design this as an iOS app. I don't know. I don't even know if it can do this. Like I don't know if this just does web apps. Um so we might be looking at a zero on 10 here, but uh but you know, we like to try it. We like to push the limits here on the Startup Ideas podcast. Uh there are other as I mentioned on the show before there are other apps that specifically focus on mobile. So there's an app called RO ROR build native mobile apps fast. There's an app called the Vibe Code app um which is uh by my friend Riley. And then there's another one. Well, yeah, I think it's called create anything. Yeah, create anything.com. create anything.com. Um, which has uh a lot of people recently are are are saying a lot of good things about it. Um, I need to spend more time playing with it and I'll be doing more episodes on mobile uh soon. So, it's still uh cooking. It says, \"This response generates a complete React application called Gains, a fitness gains is actually a killer name.\" Killer name. It features a mascot that reacts to your workout habits. Oh, let's get these gains. Are you kidding me? This is It got the streak. It's got the goal maintenance mode. See if I click around here. Your activity, your gains calendar, your top contributors. That's really cool. Imagine like it integrates with Apple Health. You can log it. It won't let me. It does. It won't let me log it here. I clicked nothing happened, but you know, I can imagine giving it more data around what how it should log things. And there's no settings. But overall from a design perspect perspective like the mascot kind of kind of is tough, right? It looks really good. Um, it looks really really good. And I would say this is an from a from a one prompt. I'm going to give this an 8.3 on 10. I want to also mention that Google has released something called anti-gravity. Anti-gravity is basically their cursor competitor. you can design using Gemini 3.0 um in in anti-gravity, but the designs that you are going to get, at least that I've tried, I haven't been able to get as nice of designs out of it. So, uh you know, maybe it's just me, probably not. I don't think so. But if you want to get the most out of uh Gemini 3.0 Pro, uh, you're going to want to go to, um, direct to, uh, Google AI Studio. There you have it, folks. Overall, like I'm impressed, you know, like we're we're getting scary. It's getting scary good. And if you just keep prompting it, I think you can get to places where you have an extremely welldesigned app without any designers. You are the designer, right? You have to have the taste. You have to have the reference images. Um, and but I think I think you can go and and design something beautiful. And we've exited this era where vibe coding produced not the most beautiful websites, not the most beautiful apps, and we're getting to a point that with the right reference images, the right prompts, you can get to a place where you design something beautiful. So, um, hope this got your creative juices flowing. Stop listening to me and just get your hands dirty. Go play with one of these tools. Go play with Gemini 3.0. and uh build something and come back to the comment section. I read every single comment on YouTube. Share this podcast, like it so I know to keep doing these episodes. Um otherwise, um I don't know. I don't know what you like or what you don't like or if I should just not post at all. So, uh thanks so much for spending your time with me. We learned about how to become uh pretty proficient, I would say, uh at Google AI Studio Gemini 3.0 AI designer stuff. And uh until next time, have a creative day, my friends.",
