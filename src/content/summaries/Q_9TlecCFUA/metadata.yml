title: Claude Can Finally Chain Multiple MCPs + Skills Without Killing the Context
description: >-
  In this video, I show how I now chain multiple MCP servers and Claude Skills
  together without worrying about MCP context bloat.


  The point isn't the specific workflow. It's the pattern: a master skill that
  orchestrates other skills, which call MCP servers, all running in one context
  window. 


  You can replicate this for your own repeatable tasks.


  The specific workflow I demo completes my entire consulting client intake in a
  single chat.


  This workflow used to take me at least an hour per client—now it's done in
  minutes.


  This is now possible because of lazy loading (tool search + progressive
  disclosure). 


  Before this, loading multiple MCP servers would blow out the context window
  before you even started. That's no longer the case.


  I walk through the building blocks—remote MCP servers (Gmail, Fireflies,
  Cal.com, n8n, Notion, Stripe) and custom skills (LOE generator, Stripe payment
  links, post-call follow-up)—and then demo the full workflow with checkpoints
  along the way.
