  "fullText": "My journey to understanding super commmunication started when I was having a problem myself. I would come home from work and I would start complaining about my day and my wife very practically would say something like, \"Oh, why don't you take your boss out to lunch and you guys can get to know each other.\" And instead of being able to hear what she was saying, I would get even more upset, right? Why aren't you supporting me? You're supposed to be on my side and she would get upset that I was attacking her for giving me good advice. And so I went to researchers and I asked them like, \"Why is this happening? I'm a professional communicator. I'm a journalist.\" and they said every single discussion is made up of different kinds of conversation, practical conversations where we're solving problems together. But then there's emotional conversation. I might tell you how I'm feeling and I don't want you to solve my feelings. I want you to empathize. And then there's social conversations, which is about how we relate to each other and to society. And they said, \"What we've learned is if people aren't having the same kind of conversation at the same moment, they have real trouble hearing each other.\" And the reason why I bring this up for marketing and for artists, storytelling is a bundle of all three conversations that tells you what kind of conversation you're",
