title: How People Are Using AI for Health
description: >-
  OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health as a dedicated encrypted workspace connecting
  medical records and wellness apps with isolated health memory. Company data
  shows over 40 million weekly users ask about symptoms, test results,
  treatments, insurance navigation, and after-hours care, especially in rural
  and underserved areas. Discussions focus on clinical adoption, potential to
  streamline care and build a health-data moat, and worries about privacy,
  regulation, and startup disruption.
