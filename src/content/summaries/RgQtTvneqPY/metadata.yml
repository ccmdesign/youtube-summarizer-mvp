  _______________________
  What's really happening with AI this week? The common story is that healthcare launches are about consumer demand and robotics is still coming soon — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on five stories that actually matter from the last week:

   • Why OpenAI and Anthropic healthcare launches are really about IPO narratives
   • What Yan LeCun's departure from Meta signals about the LLM scaling debate
   • How physical AI crossed from coming soon to here now
   • Why OpenAI is paying contractors to upload real work from past employers

  The training data is exhausted. The public internet has been scraped. The next frontier requires data that doesn't exist in accessible form — the actual work products people create in their jobs. Meanwhile, ChatGPT built a browser from scratch in one week with three million lines of code.

  For builders and leaders, the capability curve has tipped over — the question now is what compounds into real value.
