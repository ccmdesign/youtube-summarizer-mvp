So let me start with what Open AI and Anthropic actually did because the press coverage missed the point entirely. So OpenAI launched two products. They launched Chad GPC health for consumers which was very widely covered where you can sync your health data. can ask questions about your body. And they also launched OpenAI for health care for enterprises, which is a HIPPA compliant API. It has hospital system integrations. It's designed to work at scale. Enthropic followed up 5 days later with claude for healthcare, which features connectors to CMS databases and insurance claim systems. Obviously, the larger surface story is AI comes to medicine. Certainly part of the consumer story is that we can see from chat volume that consumers talk about health matters with LLMs regularly. And so to some extent the easiest read of this is that this is a defensive play by both chat GPT and Claude because if you are talking with consumers about personal health matters you have a higher standard of care you have to exercise and it probably justifies the product investment on that basis alone. But I think there's another story here. The graveyard of healthcare AI is vast and well populated and it is tempting to see these skeptically as a result. I'm going to give you an example. IBM Watson did an oncology product a few years ago. It was supposed to revolutionize cancer care. It had some great initial results. It got sold for parts in 2022. Google's deep mind has done a great job with protein folding and we have various drugs inspired by AI in the drug pipeline but to be honest none has yet hit the market and become a hit has none has yet reached millions of people so the natural question to ask when AI launches a healthcare product is what's different now here's the story I think nobody is talking about both companies are approaching the public markets and they need a story that is a little bit different from chatbot for consumers or just chatbot for work. Healthcare provides a really compelling IPO story. And you might think this is really early. Neither company has announced an IPO date. Why would we care about IPO at this point? I would argue back if you want a thriving healthc care story that can be part of your public company narrative, you got to start early. You got to start early. So you have existing partnerships with hospitals. You have health care data that's working. You could talk about millions of consumers benefiting from using your product for health care. That narrative takes time to develop. It is time to start now. And think about how much power that narrative has. Right? You're in a regulated industry which suggests the seriousness of the business. You have HIPPA compliance versus technical sophistication. You have hospital partnerships which suggest enterprise credibility. It's a good story for investors. And not to mention in the US you have the rising spend on health care which investors read as rising revenue if you're in that space for better or worse. Right now I want to be careful here. I'm not saying that the health care products that Anthropic and OpenAI launched are just vaporware. I'm actually saying the opposite. So for example the prior authorization use case Anthropic called out when they launched where a doctor submits paperwork to an insurance company for treatment approval. That's a $30 billion annual administrative burden. That is a real business. So I think many things can be true at once. The healthc care story can be both a story about these major model makers responding to real consumer existing demand for healthcare advice from AI and also a story about positioning themselves into a growing spend category in the economy that they can play on as they start to court public investors. eventually maybe late 26 maybe late 27 we don't have an idea yet when those IPO dates will be the larger question if we're thinking strategically is what happens to the healthcare AI market structure if both major foundation model companies are competing directly and this is worth thinking about regardless of healthcare because I think we'll see this in other places as well because every healthcare AI startup just had their build versus buy calculation rewritten why would a hospital system partner with a healthcare AI startup when they can get HIPPA compliant claude or chat GPT directly from source. One of the things that we're learning is that because AI makes it easy to write code, AI makes it easy to build out new features on an existing platform if you have distribution as both Anthropic and Chat GPT do to differing degrees. And that means that when they see a successful pattern, when they see something they want to build into, they're able to build into that space very quickly and efficiently. and they then pose a very tricky set of problems to smaller startups in that space. This is less a big company problem and more a startup question. Foundation model companies are moving down the stack into vertical applications. They're not content just to be the API that startups build on. They want to get application revenue where they see interesting use cases. So if you're building an AI startup in any vertical, what you should be asking yourself is if OpenAI launches a product with the same underlying model and their distribution, what happens to us? What's our differentiator at that point? So the healthcare announcements are partly about healthcare, but they're also about vertical integration and I think they're about starting to tell stories that will be appealing in the public markets and I think that's getting overlooked. Second big story, what Yan Lun's departure actually means. So Yan Lun left Meta after more than a decade and he said a lot on the way out. So to give you some context, Lacun is one of three people credited with the deep learning revolution alongside Jeffrey Hinton and Yoshua Beno. He's not he's not a middle manager. He's one of the founders of the field and he let loose in a Financial Times interview. First, he confirmed that Meta fudged their llama for benchmarks using different model variants for different tests to inflate scores, which I don't know, whatever he signed, he decided he didn't care. Second, he said Mark Zuckerberg basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved in the Llama for release after discovering that the benchmarks were fudged and quote sideline the entire GEI organization, which makes sense looking in from the outside. And that is why he brought in new leadership. That is why he went on that spending spree to bring in new people. Most importantly though, Lun continued to say that LLMs are a dead end that don't lead to super intelligence. He has been saying that for a while and it is one of the most fundamental differences in Silicon Valley and every now and then it's worth revisiting so we stay current because someone has to be very wrong. Either Lun is out of touch and LLMs have no scaling wall and will keep going toward AGI or he's right and a lot of the folks who are pouring lots of money into AI and scaling are going to find out that they're overshooting and other founders Dario Amade comes to mind will be very honest about the fact that they have not seen the top of the scaling wall but by definition you can't see it till it appears and so this is an example of a lot of very smart people certainly much smarter than me or you arguing over something that nobody can prove until they run into it. And so essentially Lun is saying fundamentally LLMs cannot build world models. They don't possess the attributes needed for intelligence. I'm going to found my own startup and he is that is going to work on a different path to intelligence. If this reminds you of Ilia Sutsgiver, it should. But while he goes that way, we continue to see gains in agents doing longer and longer and longer tasks. all report on a new record just later in this video. And we don't see an end to scaling with LLMs. We don't see gaps in generalization pace of gains. And I want to be precise about that because LLMs as a whole still have some fragile generalization abilities. They still don't generalize as well as humans do, but they are getting better and better and better and better and they are closing gaps. So, I don't know who's right. I'm letting you know that there is a big fight between some of the smartest people in the world and we're all going to get to sit on the sidelines and figure out who's right over the next couple of years because it will take just one or two more years to see who is correct about reaching AGI and that's one of the exciting things about being alive right now. The next story is about physical AI. So obviously Nvidia launched the Reuben platform at CES. We talked about that last week. In the same week, Google DeepMind and Boston Dynamic announced a partnership to put Gemini Foundation model into Atlas robots with initial deployment in highendai factories. And Nvidia also at the same time unveiled its Alpa NIO family of open AI models. Open AAI not meaning the company meaning literally open models for autonomous vehicles. And Jensen, who loves to find a good line and he's so good at it, said the Chad GPT moment for robotics is here. which I think is a great summary. So, let me dive in a little bit to what's being built on the robotics side because it's not entirely clear from the wealth of announcements that appeared. So, for the past couple of years, the AI story has been about language models, chat bots, coding assistance, text generation, you you get the idea. What has changed, what has turned robots from coming soon into here now is a convergence of three technologies that had not previously worked together. First, foundation models can now do genuine multimodal reasoning. So, if you get Claude, if you get Gemini, if you get Chat GPT, they can look at an image and understand what's in it and reason about spatial relationships and generate plans. This is the perception and reasoning layer that a lot of robots have had trouble with in the past. Second, simulation environments are now quite good. Nvidia's Omniverse and similar platforms can create synthetic scenarios that transfer to real world performance. Now, Omniverse was not a great hit when it came out last year, but I think directionally it shows where you can go to solve the data problem because we've seen very successful data problem solutions in a similar private company environment, not in Nvidia, but at Tesla, where Tesla used lots and lots and lots and lots of training data to solve autonomous driving. Third, edge inference chips are here and they have become powerful enough to run real models on the robot rather than from the server. And that is a big technical breakthrough. So Nvidia's Jetson T4000, which was announced at CES this year, it delivers four times the AI compute of previous generations inside the same power envelope. And so the robot does not need to phone home as much to make a decision. Now, Nvidia's at the heart of all of this, as you would expect. And here's their strategic play. They're building the full stack for physical AI from data center training infrastructure, think Ruben, to edge inference, think Jetson, to simulation, to open models like Alpaio. They want to be the platform that all of us are building robots on, regardless of whether those robots come from Boston Dynamics or a Chinese manufacturer or Tesla. The Boston Dynamics partnership is particularly interesting because it's explicitly described as a data collection exercise. So, Gemini powered Atlas robots will work in high-end factories and the data from those deployments will train the next generation of models. And this is the beginning of an interesting manufacturing flywheel for robotics because you're going to be able to deploy robots. You're going to be able to collect data to train better models to deploy better and faster robots that speeds up fast. The strategic question is whether physical AI follows the same scaling dynamics as language models because if it does, the first movers who accumulate embodied data are going to have compounding advantages. And of course, Nvidia by positioning itself as the infrastructure layer is going to win regardless of which robot company succeeds. Now, there's always the harder question. Is physical AI actually closer now or is this just another false dawn? I've been watching the space for a while and this is what makes me a little bit more optimistic this time. It's the foundational model piece. Previous generation of robots were just brittle because they were too hardcoded on perception systems. We now have much more flexible perception systems. We have early indications in December of 2025 and January of 2026 that models are starting to be able to generalize from video and learn on their own how to take actions. I think we are at a point where we are starting to see the first indicators of a flywheel forming around robotics. And I think a lot of the story of 2026 is going to be about the companies that figure out how to take the first turn or two at that flywheel so that they can begin to accumulate knowledge and make better robotic systems heading into 2027 2028. So the practical implication is that if you're in an industry that involves physical operations, you need to change your narrative from the robots are coming to the robots are around and we need to figure out when to get a robot into place and start to learn and get that flywheel turning. Next story, the training data is exhausted. This is buried, right? It was very hard to find this, but I think it's super significant. It was in a wired report that OpenAI and a company called Handshake AI are asking contractors to upload real on the job work from past employers. The examples requested include Word docs, PDFs, PowerPoints, Excel files, images, and code repos. By the way, if you're worried about AI leaking to AI, maybe you should worry more about former employees leaking doc. Contractors are told to delete proprietary and personal identifiable information. Sure, I don't know that it always happens. Now the story got almost no attention but it is strategically significant because it suggests that the easy training data is exhausted. The public internet is no longer useful. It has been scraped. Books have been scraped. The next frontier of capability improvement requires data that isn't currently existing in any accessible form. The actual work products that people create in their jobs. Think about what that means. Large language models are trained on text that was written to be read. But most of the valuable work in the economy isn't written to be widely read. It's in internal documents, in project files, in analysis spreadsheets. That's the data that would let AI do the knowledge work, not just discuss it. And OpenAI is trying to acquire that data by essentially paying contractors to upload previous work. And that's a brute force approach. It raises pretty obvious legal and ethical questions, but it reveals the strategic priority. Whoever assembles the best corpus of how people actually do work will have a significant advantage in building AI that can do the work. And this connects into that larger physical AI story, doesn't it? The reason robot training has been hard is the same reason knowledge work has been hard. Relevant data is hard to get in accessible form. And that is why this partnership with Highendai is really significant. The implication for companies is that your internal data is about to become strategically valuable in a way it never was. The work products that your teams create, the processes they follow, that's training data that somebody is going to want to improve AI systems. And the question is how you either capture that value yourself or how you protect it so it doesn't leak out to foundation model companies. I also think the Claude code story deserves more attention. Claude Code blew up on X over December and into January as an emergent phenomenon where people were talking about running their Claude code to do all sorts of things from growing tomatoes to wiring up their homes. Boris Churnney, the creator of Claude Code, shared his own workflow just this past week. He runs five to 10 Claude instances at the same time. Uses Opus 4.5 exclusively and maintains a file with claude.mmarkdown where every mistake Claude makes is converted into a permanent rule. So his claws get better over time. By maintaining a single markdown file with a lot of rules for Claude to review before submitting work, Boris can supervise Claude much more lightly. Now he's a coder. He's an engineer. So a lot of what Claude is doing for him is coding tasks. And so a lot of his rules are effectively rules that Claude's PRs or engineering code submissions have to pass in order to be successful. Most of those individual attempts may fail, but because Boris has rigged up five or 10 parallel cloud instances to constantly check against a regularly updated rule set, he can just kind of sit back a little bit, focus on what he wants to build, and let Claude iterate until it gets it right. That's an example of how fast the frontier is moving. And I found another example from chat GPT that's even more eyeopening. So this past week, Michael Tru, who is a co-founder at Cursor, shared that they built a browser, an internet browser from scratch, from nothing, using chat GPT 5.2. It ran uninterrupted for, wait for it, an entire week, and it produced 3 million lines of code. It produced a rendering engine in Rust with HTML parsing, a CSS cascade, layout, text shaping, the ability to paint pixels, and a custom JavaScript VM. Now, Michael was honest. He said it kind of works. Simple websites render quickly and largely correctly. It's not yet close to Chromium parody. Chromium famously is the browser engine that powers Chrome and many other browsers. But let the core concept sink in here. Building a browser engine is one of the hardest tasks in software engineering. There are only three rendering engines in the world. Chromium for Chrome, Gecko for Firefox, and WebKit for Safari. Each represents thousands of engineer years of work. Now, there's a fourth written by a single agent running for a week. Now, true is clear. There's some issues. It's not yet matching real browsers, but that's precisely what makes this credible. We're not trying to cherrypick an example here. We're talking about an agent that produced a functional version of an extremely complicated system in a time frame that would have been unthinkable 3 months ago. And this is the larger story behind the clawed code explosion. I think people think about it as is it cla I'm stepping back and what I'm realizing is the capabilities that we see in Opus 4.5 and chat GPT 5.2 have crossed a tipping point for builders. The excitement we see is not tool driven. It is around the capabilities that these tools are enabling all of us to unlock together. And that's why I deliberately highlighted stories from both chat GPT and Claude because I think the larger story around the Claude code enthusiasm is that it's not Claude codec coded, pun intended. It is actually about the ability to build things and how quickly that's tipped over. Now again, the browser doesn't compete with Chrome. Don't look for it to compete with Chrome, but get a sense of where the capability curve is at. Coding is progressing extremely quickly because it's very easy to retry. It's very easy to see success criteria and it's very easy to run a feedback loop. One of the big challenges of 2026 is how AI agents will progress very quickly in a domain where the feedback loop is not as consistent and the success criteria is more ambiguous like the rest of knowledge work. Help me with my email. analyze this situation. Those are more complicated than coding tasks for AI. This week, Anthropic released Claude co-work and is positioned as Claude code for the rest of your work and it's laser focused on that second challenge. It's a sandboxed environment where Claude can access files and execute actions and complete multi-step tasks. I did a whole video on it. Whether it works depends on whether users can define success criteria for non-coding tasks. That is hard because users are often not able to articulate themselves that clearly. Now to Claude's credit, when I have done testing with Claude Co-work, what I have found is that they have done some training and iterating on that model so that if you have common work tasks, you can use generally correct English commands that are not very long to invoke a very useful piece of work. And so what I mean by that if you is if you say something like please make me a nice presentation using this data they have done enough training on claude that it can get to a presentation that's pretty good even if it feels sort of in the typical claude aesthetic style. So I think the encouraging thing is just as we saw earlier in this video, AI companies are using work product, real work product from real companies to train these models so that we can use somewhat vague English in order to get decent work product back. that still leaves room for people who want to do excellent work to get better at prompting to get better at defining outputs and defining correctness in knowledge work and to get extraordinary results from new tools like claude co-work and so I think the larger story of the whole cloud code moment is that these models have tipped over into new capability layer people are very excited and we are going to try the next big challenge which cla coowork is the first sign of and that is getting AI to start to really dig into knowledge work So where does this leave us overall? The AI industry spent the last 3 years building capability sets, right? Models kept getting bigger, benchmarks kept improving, demos got more and more impressive. The assumption was that that capability would translate into value. That better models would mean more products and revenue. That assumption is being tested this year. We are finding out this year whether getting into health care matters, whether getting into clawed co-work is going to work, whether getting into physical AI will scale. And so the AI industry as a whole is discovering what is compounding and valuable out of all of the experimentation that we've done in the past couple of years. And we as the users, as the builders are going to be a part of figuring out what truly has value here. So if I leave you with one thing, if you're in physical work at all, robotics needs to be on your mind. And if you're in software at all, you got to play with claude co-work. Both of those are big stories that have to do with that compounding piece that we all get to be a part of. All right, have fun. Get building. That's the news for the",
