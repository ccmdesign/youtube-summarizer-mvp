title: "Context Graphs: AI's Next Big Idea"
description: >-
  Context graphs capture decision traces, exceptions, precedents, and
  cross-system signals explaining why past choices occurred and making automated
  decisions auditable. Analysis contrasts traditional systems of record and data
  warehouses with cross-system agents requiring accessible decision lineage for
  reliable automation. Implications include context engineering, organizational
  change management, and design approaches enabling agents to discover
  organizational schema from real usage rather than predefined schemas.
