  "fullText": "Today we are talking about why everyone is talking about context graphs. What are they? Why you need to pay attention? And why they might be AI's next big idea. Welcome back to the AI daily brief. You could feel basically everyone in the business world right now shaking off the slumber and restfulness of the holidays and starting to get back to work. And I anticipate that it will be almost no time before we start getting big announcements in AI land again. However, as people come back, there have been a couple of conversations recently which I think are particularly pertinent to the shape of the AI industry and what people are focused on building and implementing in 2026. And one of those is this idea of context graphs. The concept is about what it takes to get agents to do more and more important work, which it turns out some argues is not just about giving them access to better organized data, but about giving them access to a type of data which right now might not exist. So today we're going to talk about what contacts are and why everyone's talking about it. But we actually have to go back to an essay from earlier in December by investor Jamine Ball who wrote long live systems of record. And while his starting point was a debate in the startup and VC world around how agents change systems of record and what it means for the startup landscape, underlying this is actually a much more important conversation about how AI is going to intersect with human knowledge work. The animating idea that serves as our jumping off point comes when Ball writes, \"If an enterprise workflow needs to know something at a specific step, where is the one place that answer is considered canonical?\" Because as workflows get more automated and more agent-driven, the fragility point often has nothing to do with the model and everything to do with whether the agent pulled the right value from the right system at the right time. Now, Ball goes on to dramatize this. He writes, \"Anyone who has spent time inside a large company knows how messy this gets in practice. Take something as simple as what is our ARR? Ask the sales or and you will get one number. Ask finance and you get another with a different set of exclusions and adjustments. Ask accounting and now you're talking revenue recognition, not bookings. Ask legal and they will correctly remind you that half the ARR in a fast growing business is backed by contracts that look nothing like the neat recurring subscriptions you want it to be. Now he continues, imagine you tell an agent, go calculate ARR by segment and send a deck to the board. Which ARR should it use? Which table is canonical? If sales and finance disagree, who wins? If the billing system and the warehouse have drifted by a few%, which one does the agent treat as truth? The more we automate, the more important it becomes that someone has done the unglamorous work of deciding what the correct answer is and where it lives. Now, Paul points out that even before agents, rationalizing and reconciling all this data is something that has been a priority for big companies over the last decade. It's where we got all of these data lakehouse and data warehouse companies. However, in practice, how much these things actually change the way companies operate is up for debate. Ball writes, \"The problem is that most of this lived downstream of the operational world. The sales team still lived in Salesforce. The finance team still closed the books in Netswuite. The support team still worked tickets in Zenesk. The warehouse or lakehouse was the retrospective mirror, not the transactional front door. Now agents come along and in his words change the equation. Agents are inherently cross-system, meaning they don't live solely within one of those functions and they are actionoriented. They are not just trying to gather information. They are trying to make use of that information to do things. That combination, he writes, means agents are only as good as their understanding of which system owns which truth and what the contract is between those truths. Under the hood, something still has to say this is the canonical customer record or this is the legally binding contract term or this number is the one we report to Wall Street. That something might be a traditional system of record. It might be a warehouse back semantic layer or it might be a new class of data control plane product but it is absolutely not going away. Now this is where we jump from the systems of record essay into the context graph idea. This was written again by investors Jay Agupta and Ashug from Foundation Capital which they called AI's trillion dollar opportunity context graphs. Their key observation is that there is actually an entire category of information missing. They write, \"Balls framing assumes the data agents need already lives somewhere, and agents just need better access to it, plus better governance, semantic contracts, and explicit rules about which definition wins for which purpose.\" That's half the picture. The other half is the missing layer that actually runs enterprises. The decision traces, the exceptions, overrides, precedents, and cross-system context that currently lives in Slack threads, deal conversations, escalation calls, and people's heads. The distinction, the authors say, is between rules and decision traces. Rules, they say, tell an agent what should happen in general, whereas decision traces capture what happened in this specific case. I think for our purposes on this episode, an even simpler way to understand it is the what versus why gap. And the simple idea here is that while systems of record are good at state, i.e. this particular deal closed at a 20% discount, they are bad at decision lineage. Why a 20% discount was allowed this time? As the authors point out, those decision traces, i.e. The why lives in Slack and DMs and in meetings and in human heads, limiting how much autonomy can then scale. As the authors put it, agents don't just need rules. They need access to the decision traces that show how rules were applied in the past, where exceptions were granted, how conflicts were resolved, who approved what, and which precedents actually govern reality. Now, the good news, they say, is that agents have a really great ability to collect exactly this sort of information. They write system of agent startups sit in the execution path. They see the full context at decision time. What inputs were gathered across systems? What policy was evaluated? What exception route was invoked? Who approved and what state was written? If you persist those traces, you get something that doesn't exist in most enterprises today. A queryable record of how decisions were made. And this is what they call the context graph. The sum total of those decision traces. as they put it, a living record of decision traces stitched across entities in time. So precedent becomes searchable over time. The context graph becomes the real source of truth for autonomy because it explains not just what happened but why it was allowed to happen. Again, the what versus why. So just to make this crisp, here are a couple other examples that they give. One category is exception logic that lives in people's heads. For example, we always give healthcare companies an extra 10% because their procurement cycles are brutal. That's not in the CRM. They point out it's tribal knowledge passed down through onboarding and side conversations. Another category is precedent from past decisions. We structured a similar deal for company X last quarter. We should be consistent. Again, this is the common knowledge of the organization that lives in conversations, not queriable databases. Another obvious but important one is cross-system synthesis where a person a human looks across data in Salesforce open escalations in Zenesk read a slack thread where someone flagged churn risk and ultimately synthesized all of that in their head decided to escalate leaving a record that only says escalated to tier 3. The final category of examples they give are approval chains that happen outside of structured systems. And this happens all the time. your boss happens to be walking by and you ask them if you can add an additional 5% to the discount. They give a thumbs up and keep walking. The record is only going to show the final price, not who approved the deviation or why. The context graph is the sum total of all those decision traces if and as they get captured. So what would it look like to actually have this context graph available and play out in real life? Here's the example they give. A renewal agent proposes a 20% discount. policy caps renewals at 10% unless a service impact exemption is approved. The agent pulls three SEV1 incidents from pager duty, an open cancel unless fixed escalation in Zenesk, and the prior renewal thread where a VP approved a similar exemption last quarter. It routes the exception to finance, finance approves. The CRM ends up with one fact, 20% discount. The context graph, however, has all of that information about why it contains all of those decision traces. And once you have the decision records they write, the why becomes first class data. Over time, these records naturally form a context graph. The entities the business already cares about, counts, renewals, tickets, incidents, policies, approvers, and agent runs connected by decision events, the moments that matter, and why links. Companies can now audit and debug autonomy and turn exceptions into precedent instead of relearning the same edge cases in Slack every quarter. The feedback loop they conclude is what makes this compound. captured decision traces become searchable precedent and every automated decision adds another trace to the graph. Now the big question quite obviously becomes how do you start to map this? Is this something that can only be forward-looking or is there any way to go backwards? Is this something that is only going to be relevant as agents come online which can naturally create this context graph and map the why or are we talking about adding the mapping of decision traces to the human processes that exist right now. For example, are you asking leaders to talk to a voice agent after making decisions that does that capturing and categorizing? Now, this essay was hugely resonant and tons and tons of people took and ran with the ideas. And one of the areas where people spent the most time is in this question of how best to design these systems. One of the most interesting follow-ups came from the cogent enterprise substack who basically argued to not pre-onstrain the AI in the design of these context graphs. And this a little bit hearkens back to the idea that I've shared before of why I think automating existing human workflows is sort of a dead end or at least is mostly about short-term value. My argument is that ultimately agents are going to find ways to do things that come to the same output differently than the way that humans would do it. And so trying to constrain agents to just doing the exact same things that human did doesn't really make sense. The cogent enterprise substack is arguing something similar about how we think about the design of context graph mapping. They write the most counterintuitive development. We shouldn't predefine these context graphs. Traditional knowledge graphs fail because they require predefining structure up front. Context graphs invert this completely. Modern agents act as informed walkers through your decision landscape. As an agent solves a problem, traversing through APIs, querying documentation, reviewing past tickets, it discovers the organizational oncology on the fly, it learns which entities actually matter and how they genuinely relate through use, not through a manual schema someone designed in a workshop. Each trajectory leaves a trace, which systems were touched together, which data points co-occurred in decision chains, how conflicts were resolved. Accumulate thousands of these walks and something remarkable emerges. The organizational schema reveals itself from actual usage patterns rather than predetermined assumptions. These become world models, not just retrieval systems. Trying to give this a specific example, you can imagine in a lot of organizations that they have one type of policy that in practice they break almost every time. In other words, the exception isn't actually the exception. It's just the rule, but for whatever reason, it's not been codified into policy. Going back to that discounting for health companies example from the original piece, if that happens every time, that's actually not an exception. That's just the policy in practice when it comes to that type of organization. And what Cogjent Enterprise is arguing is that if you allow the agents to figure out this organizational schema from the actual real life experience, they're going to be able to show those policy in practice areas rather than be constrained by the preassumptions of policy that people would have programmed into them. Now, of course, the other question that comes up is where humans fit in all of this. Box's Aaron Levy also wrote an essay about similar themes called the era of context. One of the big questions that he explored was that if everyone has the same access to talent, i.e. all of these agentic super intelligences, how do they then differentiate? What makes a difference between a good company and a great company? For him, it comes back to context and how we design for it. And here Aaron puts crisply why context engineering was one of my key predictions for enterprise AI in 2026. He writes, \"Designing our systems to get agents access to that data and ensuring that all of our agents can interoperate on that data is going to be incredibly important. Further, companies will have to drive a substantial amount of change management to make this all work. We imagined that AI systems would adapt to how we work. But it turns out due to their extreme power and inherent limitations, we will instead adapt to how they work. This means we will have to optimize our organizations and workflows to best enable context for agents to be successful. The core tenant of this change is that the user is responsible now for directing and guiding agents on how to do their work, ensuring it gets the right context along the way. In essence, he writes, the individual contributor of today becomes the manager of agents in the future. Their new responsibilities will be providing the oversight and escalation paths, a meaningful amount of coordination throughout the work that the agents are doing, and shephering work between the various agents. Just like managers of teams in the preAI era, one might say that the decision traces that make up the context graph are the most uniquely human part of how work gets done. They are the decisions that break the rules or even if they don't break the rules technically, break out of the patterns by which previous decisions were made. So much of being a good company is about being nimble and responding to reality as it presents itself, not as you imagined it. And it seems to me that as we figure out and negotiate the relationship between agent workers and human workers, it's likely that a lot of the human roles are going to be in these areas of judgment. Anyways guys, that is a little primer on context graphs. I think it's a concept that you're going to hear a lot more about this year as part of the larger conversation around context engineering and hopefully you now feel more prepared. For now, that is going to do it for today's AI daily brief. Appreciate you listening or watching as always and until next time, peace.",
