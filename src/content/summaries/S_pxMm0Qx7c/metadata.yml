title: Claude Code's Creator Has a Surprisingly Vanilla Setup
description: >-
  Boris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code, just shared how he and his team at
  Anthropic actually use Claude Code—and it's surprisingly vanilla. In this
  video, I break down his 13 tips and filter them for users who don't have
  unlimited tokens.


  What's interesting: he barely mentions MCP servers or skills. Instead, he
  focuses on plan mode, slash commands, subagents, hooks, and permission
  management. I add my own take on what's practical for the rest of us who are
  "usage engineering" to avoid burning through limits.
