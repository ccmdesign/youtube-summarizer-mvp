  "fullText": "So Boris Churnney, the creator of Cloud Code, shared a threads post about how he and his team at Enthropic use cloud code. I think this post is relevant for Cloud Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, all the other CLI tools because a lot of these are based off of cloud code. They all support MCB servers. They're now adding skills. So even if you're using a different CLI tool, there are still some good gems for you to learn from this post. And it's very interesting because Cloud Code is super customizable, but he actually uses it with a very low amount of customizations. And let's take all of this with a huge grain of salt. And I'll tell you why. Cloud code usage is not the same for every user. We already know about the limitations of the pro plan. And we already know that even if you're on the max plan, sometimes you don't get the same usage. Sometimes the model is degraded. And in most cases, a lot of us are not just context engineering, but we're usage engineering. We're making sure we're getting the most out of cloud code without wasting tokens and without wasting usage. And Boris Journey and his team don't have that problem because they have unlimited token usage. So what they show here might not be exactly how you and I can use it, but we can still take a lot from it and learn how to optimize our workflows given our downto-earth limitations. For those that don't know Boris Churnney, he works at Enthropic and he created cloud code as a side project. Keep in mind this is when cursor was taking off about a year later. Coding and AI engineering is the number one AI use case right now. As pointed out by open router state of AI paper. I'll link to my video on that above. But cloud code changed the game because since cloud code came out, there have been a ton of new agentic CLI coding agents. Codeex and Gemini to name a few, but there are so many more. And in my opinion, Cloud Code is still the best. It has the best model and has the most advanced feature set. I still use Gemini CLI and Codex CLI and a bunch of other coding tools, but Cloud Code is my go-to. So, anyways, yesterday he created this post. I created Cloud Code. Lots of people have asked me how I use Cloud Code, so I wanted to show off my setup a bit. My setup might be surprisingly vanilla. Cloud Code works right out of the box, so I don't customize it much. There is no correct way to use Cloud Code. We built it in a way that you can use it, customize it, and hack it however you like. On this channel specifically, we talk about MCB servers, skills, slash commands, hooks, sub aents, rules, and so many more ways to customize cloud code. But according to Boris, he uses it pretty much out of the box. So, let's see. I run five claws in parallel in my terminal. I number my tabs one through five and use system notifications to know when cla needs input. Looks to me like he's using iTerm 2, which is a terminal tool for Mac. They have this functionality to have multiple terminals in his tab interface, and he labels them one through five, so he knows which one needs his input. He also runs five to 10 clots on claw.ai. So cloud code on the web in parallel with local clots. As I code in my terminal, I will often hand off local sessions to web or manually kick off sessions in Chrome. I also start a few sessions from my phone in the cloud iOS app. So five terminal sessions, five to 10 web sessions and multiple sessions via the cloud iOS app. It's already setting off some alarm bells in my head just because that's a lot of tokens. That's a lot of usage. That's a way to charge your credit card or hit your usage limits really, really fast. So it's cool that he uses it like this. But for the average Joe, I don't know how cost effective this is. Number three, I use Opus45 with Thingy for everything. It's the best coding model I've ever used. It's better than Sonnet since you have to steer less and it's better at tool use. Agreed. I only use Opus45 right now. Our team shares a single CloudMD file for the cloud code repo. We check it into git and the whole team contributes multiple times a week. Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly, we add it to the cloudmd file so Claude knows not to do it next time. So, in theory, this is cool, but if you've been running CLA for a while or any of these aent decoders, you know that their main agent file eventually gets too long. I try to keep mine no longer than 200 lines, if not less than that, because I've seen claw.md files not be too effective lately. So, to say that the whole team is updating it weekly, I can only imagine what their actual claw.md file looks like. But what's interesting here, the topmost rules always use bun, not npm. And of course, Anthropic just bought bun. and bun is newer and technically better than npm, but claude code usually goes back to npm. Anyways, during code review, I'll often tag claude on my co-workers PRs to add something to the cloud MD. We also use the cloud code GitHub action. So, what's interesting here is he's actually using the comments in GitHub to tag Claude to modify their cla.md file. I haven't done this before, but I'll give it a shot. Number six is the one that most resonates with me and this channel. Most sessions start in plan mode. All of my sessions start in plan mode. If my goal is to write a pull request, I will use plan mode and go back and forth with Claude until I like its plan. From there, I'll switch into auto accept edit mode and CL can usually oneshot it. A good plan is really important. 100% agree. I spend so much time in plan mode. By the way, the way I actually use plan mode is I first give my PRD, then I tell Claude to use the ask user question tool to ask me questions about my PRD. Then I switch into plan mode and then I start going back and forth with the plan and the outputs come out so much better. Seven, I use slash commands for every interloop workflow that I do many times a day. This saves me from repeated prompting. Slash commands are essentially reusable prompts that you can do by just typing slash and then whatever you named it as. In this case is using commit PRs, but there's many use cases for slash commands. It really depends on what you're doing repeatedly. They're really easy to create. It's really cool is that Claude can now also use those slash commands on its own. Use a few sub agents regularly. Similar to the slash commands, I think of sub agents as automating the most common workflows that I do for most PRs. I've covered sub agents before. I'll link to that video above. Essentially, you create a sub agent within cloud code that has its own context window. It has its own system prompt. It has its own access to tools. And you can have your main agent call that sub agent to do that task. I do it a lot for QA testing. I do it a lot for research. So, when I'm doing something with my main claude agent, I don't want to bloat that context window. I have it call that specific sub agent to do that task. It can even run in the background and then come back and give the answer or the data to my main agent. They're really easy to make. My advice though is not to overdo it. Not everything should be done as a sub agent. Sometimes a slash command is enough and sometimes a skill is enough. So now he talks about hooks. We use a post tool hook to format Claude's code. Claude usually generates well formatted code out of the box and the hook handles the last 10% to avoid formatting errors. Hooks are essentially a way to monitor events. I have hooks for when tools are used, when agents finish, and when agents need my feedback. Very useful and also very easy to set up. Now number 10 is something I found very interesting as well. He doesn't use the dangerously skip permissions tag. This is essentially yolo mode. A lot of people like this one. This lets Claude go out and do whatever it wants without asking you permission all the time. It's very beneficial when you wanted to go and do some autonomous coding. But as I'm sure everyone has experienced, sometimes Claude or Codeex or Cursor or whatever agent you're using gets a little bit too comfortable to make some commands or do some stuff on your computer that is just a headache to revert. So Boris essentially saying, I don't use YOLO mode. Instead, he does SL permissions to preallow certain bash commands that he knows that are safe for his environment to avoid unnecessary permission prompts. So, this is a great device I never thought about. I always cringe when I turn on dangerously skip permissions. I never know what's going to happen, even with cloud code 11. Cloud code uses all my tools for me. It often searches and posts to Slack via the MCB server. Runs BigQuery to answer analytics questions using the CLI. Grabs error logs from Century. So, here he's talking about tool use, specifically showing us a single MCB server. And to me, it's interesting how little he talks about MCP here. Right now, he's only showing us once. And he's also hinting how he doesn't only use MCP servers, how he also uses the BigQuery CLI to get other data. Because in most cases, if there's a CLI tool, you don't need an MCP server, assuming it exposes the same set of tools. 12. For very long running tasks, I will either prompt Claw to verify its work with a background agent when it's done. Use a stop agent hook to do that more deterministically or use the Ralph Wigan plugin. I will also use either permission mode, don't ask, or dangerously skip permissions in a sandbox to avoid permission prompts for the session. So, this kind of comes back to tip number 10 where he talks about permissions specifically when you're trying to get cloud to run longunning tasks. I think the biggest takeaway here is to have it verify its work using a stop hook. Here he talks about the Ralph Wigum plugin. For those that don't know about the Ralph Wigum plugin, it started off kind of as a joke and now Enthropic has added into their plugins. It essentially lets Claude running this infinite loop. It's a really cool idea, but if you're limited on tokens and usage, it will burn through both of those really, really fast. For someone with an unlimited credit card or maybe someone that works on anthropic team, it's awesome. But if you're being conscious of your usage, I'm not sure about that. And it final tip, the most important thing to get great results out of Claude code is give Claude a way to verify it work. If it has a feedback loop, it will give it two to three times better quality for its final result. And I talk about this a lot. I've talked about the feedback loop with Playright, with Chrome DevTools, with a Testrate MCP. Here he's talking about the new Chrome for Cloud extension, which essentially gives Claw the ability to control your Chrome browser. and look at what it's created and have that whole feedback loop as well. If you're building something that's web- based and you give Claude that feedback loop, it will help so much because Claude could check its work either from a UI visual perspective or also looking at the network, also looking at the logs and just feed that back to itself and improve it just like real developers do. So yeah, I think there's a lot to take from this. I find it pretty interesting that he didn't mention skills at all. He barely mentioned MCP. He focused on hooks and slash commands and custom agents. By his definition, this is a vanilla usage of cloud code. And I've been following Boris's journey on threads because when people comment to him about problems with cloud code, he usually replies with a solution. I suggest giving him a follow. Anyways, let me know what you think. If you have any feedback or questions, drop in the comments below. If you haven't done so already, subscribe to the channel. It really helps me to grow.
