  HIGH-PROTEIN DOUBLE CHOCOLATE COTTAGE CHEESE MOUSSE

  1 cup + 2 tablespoons (250 g) cottage cheese (full-fat or low-fat)

  1.5 tablespoons (7.5 g) cocoa powder

  1 teaspoon vanilla extract

  2 tablespoons (30 g) chocolate chips (I use Lily’s low-sugar chips)


  Optional toppings:

  Toppings: Greek yogurt, whipped cream, shaved chocolate, cacao nibs, or mini
  chocolate chips!


  INSTRUCTIONS:

  Add the cottage cheese, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a food processor
  or high-speed blender. Blend everything, scraping down the sides as needed,
  until the mixture is silky smooth.


  Melt chocolate in the microwave in 20-second increments, stirring in between
  to ensure it doesn’t burn (it’s ok to remove when there’s a bit of unmelted
  chocolate left, stir it, and the residual heat will finish the melting without
  burning).


  Add the melted chocolate to the food processor (or blender) and blend again
  until combined.

  Divide between two 4-ounce mason jars, pop on the lids, and refrigerate for at
  least 1 hour.


  Serve with a dollop of Greek yogurt and some shaved chocolate or mini chips
  and enjoy!
