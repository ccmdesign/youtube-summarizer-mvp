    HIGH-PROTEIN DOUBLE CHOCOLATE COTTAGE CHEESE MOUSSE

    1 cup + 2 tablespoons (250 g) cottage cheese (full-fat or low-fat)

    1.5 tablespoons (7.5 g) cocoa powder

    1 teaspoon vanilla extract

    2 tablespoons (30 g) chocolate chips (I use Lily’s low-sugar chips)


    Optional toppings:

    Toppings: Greek yogurt, whipped cream, shaved chocolate, cacao nibs, or mini chocolate chips!


    INSTRUCTIONS:

    Add the cottage cheese, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract to a food processor or high-speed blender. Blend everything, scraping down the sides as needed, until the mixture is silky smooth.


    Melt chocolate in the microwave in 20-second increments, stirring in between to ensure it doesn’t burn (it’s ok to remove when there’s a bit of unmelted chocolate left, stir it, and the residual heat will finish the melting without burning).


    Add the melted chocolate to the food processor (or blender) and blend again until combined.

    Divide between two 4-ounce mason jars, pop on the lids, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.


    Serve with a dollop of Greek yogurt and some shaved chocolate or mini chips and enjoy!

## Key Takeaways

This recipe transforms cottage cheese into a decadent, high-protein dessert that supports health goals without sacrificing flavor.

* **Four-ingredient base**: Requires only cottage cheese, cocoa powder, vanilla, and melted chocolate chips for a rich result.

* **Fat content affects texture**: **Full-fat** cottage cheese creates a dense mousse or ganache, while **low-fat** results in a lighter, pudding-like consistency.

* **Blood sugar management**: By prioritizing protein and using sugar-free chocolate, the dessert provides **satiety** and prevents the cycle of sugar cravings.

* **Preparation tip**: Chilling the mixture for at least 1-2 hours allows it to "set up" into a firm, mousse-like state.

## Summary

### The Foundation of Cottage Cheese Mousse
Danny Spees demonstrates how to create a rich, double-chocolate mousse using **cottage cheese** as a high-protein substitute for traditional heavy cream or egg bases. The recipe is designed to be accessible and focuses on four main ingredients: 250g (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) of cottage cheese, 1.5 tablespoons of cocoa powder, a splash of vanilla extract, and melted chocolate chips.

### Choosing Your Ingredients
The choice of cottage cheese significantly impacts the final product. Using **full-fat cottage cheese** results in a texture similar to a thick ganache or traditional mousse, making it ideal for holidays or special occasions. Conversely, **low-fat cottage cheese** yields a lighter, pudding-like consistency suitable for everyday snacks. For those monitoring sugar intake, using **sugar-free chocolate chips** (such as Lily's brand) keeps the glycemic load low. If a sweeter profile is desired, 1-2 tablespoons of **maple syrup** or a few drops of stevia can be added during the blending process.

### Step-by-Step Preparation
The process is designed for speed and simplicity:

- **Melt the chocolate**: Microwave the chocolate chips for 20-30 seconds. Stop while they still hold some shape to avoid scorching, then stir until smooth.

- **Blend**: Combine all ingredients in a food processor or blender. A **four-cup food processor** is recommended for easier scraping and removal of the final product.

- **Refine the texture**: Blend for about 40 seconds, scraping down the sides to ensure no white bits of cottage cheese remain. The goal is a silky, uniform consistency.

- **Portion and Chill**: Transfer the mixture into 4-ounce mason jars. While it can be eaten immediately, chilling for **one to two hours** (or overnight) allows the mousse to firm up and develop a deeper flavor profile.

### Nutritional and Psychological Benefits
Beyond the macronutrients, the video emphasizes the **psychology of eating**. Traditional desserts high in processed flour and sugar often trigger further cravings. This recipe leverages the **satiating power of protein** to leave the consumer feeling content and full, making it an effective tool for weight loss or fitness goals. To finish the dish, toppings like Greek yogurt, whipped cream, or **cacao nibs** add texture and visual appeal without significantly altering the nutritional profile.

## Context

The 'cottage cheese revolution' has gained massive momentum in the health and fitness community as a versatile tool for high-protein recipe swaps. This trend reflects a broader consumer shift toward **nutrient-dense eating**, where traditional comfort foods are re-engineered to support metabolic health and weight management. By using cottage cheese as a neutral, creamy base, this recipe appeals to individuals managing blood sugar, athletes seeking muscle recovery snacks, and health-conscious families looking for lower-sugar holiday alternatives. It aligns with the increasing popularity of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets like Keto and the general movement toward whole-food ingredients.
