title: Gemini 3 isn't the answer. How to Solve 1 Million Steps with 0 Errors
description: >-
  Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09030


  A revolutionary paper just dropped (November 2025) that changes everything we
  know about building AI Agents. We’ve been obsessed with bigger context windows
  and smarter models, but the "MAKER Framework" proves we were wrong.

  This breakdown explains how researchers achieved 1,000,000 logical steps with
  ZERO errors using "dumb" models and a brilliant new architecture.


  In this video:

  Why your agents fail at long tasks (The Math of Failure).

  The "MAKER" Framework explained visually.

  Why "Stateless" agents beat long-context models.

  The Scaling Law: Why Small Models + Voting is cheaper than GPT-4.
