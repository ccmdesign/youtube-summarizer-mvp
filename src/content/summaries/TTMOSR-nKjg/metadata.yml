  What's really happening in AI infrastructure as we enter 2026? The common story is it's just about faster chips — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on 10 AI stories shaping how we build in 2026:
  - Why NVIDIA's Vera Rubin platform defines the AI factory future
  - How power constraints became the real compute bottleneck
  - What Meta's $2B Manus acquisition means for AI agents
  - Where MCP joining Linux Foundation enables enterprise AI adoption
