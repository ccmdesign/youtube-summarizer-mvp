title: (Re)introducing MAX with Chris Lattner
description: >-
  At our latest Modular community meetup, CEO and Co-Founder Chris Lattner
  shares Modular’s vision for the future of AI infrastructure and dives into the
  MAX Framework. As AI workloads grow more complex and hardware more diverse,
  MAX is designed to break down barriers, bringing together modeling,
  performance, and portability in a single, open framework built for the modern
  era. This session explores why Modular is rethinking the AI stack from first
  principles and how MAX aims to democratize access to high-performance compute
  for developers everywhere.
