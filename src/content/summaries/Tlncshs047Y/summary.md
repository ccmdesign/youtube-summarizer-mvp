  title: "(Re)introducing MAX with Chris Lattner"
  description: "At our latest Modular community meetup, CEO and Co-Founder Chris Lattner shares Modular’s vision for the future of AI infrastructure and dives into the MAX Framework. As AI workloads grow more complex and hardware more diverse, MAX is designed to break down barriers, bringing together modeling, performance, and portability in a single, open framework built for the modern era. This session explores why Modular is rethinking the AI stack from first principles and how MAX aims to democratize access to high-performance compute for developers everywhere.

## Key Takeaways

Chris Lattner introduces Modular's **MAX framework**, designed to democratize AI compute and address the complexities of modern GenAI inference.

- **MAX** is a new **GenAI-native AI modeling and serving framework**, built from first principles for performance (graph compiler), ease of use (eager mode), and hardware portability, leveraging **Mojo**.

- It aims to unify the fragmented AI stack, moving beyond traditional model training frameworks like Py

Torch, which struggle with **GenAI inference** and diverse hardware.

- The framework is **pervasively open source**, offering the world's largest portable kernel library (NVIDIA, AMD, Apple), extensive models, and easy installation via familiar tools like pip/conda.

- Modular's mission is to **democratize AI** by bringing developers closer to "flops" and enabling innovation from smaller players, acknowledging that core training capabilities are emerging through community projects like **Nabla**.

## Summary

Modular's mission is to democratize AI and computational power, bringing developers closer to the hardware's full potential, or "flops." The modern AI stack is incredibly complex and fragmented, with numerous frameworks, APIs, and hardware-specific solutions. While tools like Py

Torch are excellent for traditional model training, they were not designed for the unique demands of **Generative AI (GenAI) inference** or the increasingly diverse hardware landscape.

Existing solutions for GenAI inference, such as vLLM or SGLang, often rely on massive collections of custom kernels optimized for leading hardware. This approach creates a significant barrier to entry for new chips or diverse hardware, requiring extensive re-implementation and hindering broader innovation.

### Introducing the MAX Framework
Modular is excited to (re)introduce **MAX**, a GenAI-native AI modeling and serving framework built from first principles for the modern world. MAX aims to unify performance, ease of use, and portability, drawing inspiration from the best ideas across the industry while deliberately designing for the future.

Key aspects of MAX include:

- **Performance of Graphs**: Essential for high-performance systems and modern workloads, leveraging a sophisticated graph compiler.

- **World-Class Eager Mode**: Provides flexibility for exploration and discovery, similar to Py

Torch's eager execution, without sacrificing performance.

- **Portability**: Leverages the **Mojo** programming language to ensure broad hardware support across various accelerators.

- **Arbitrary Generality**: While focused on GenAI, the underlying technology is designed to be applicable to other compute-intensive fields like quantum computing or biochemistry.

### Open Source Ecosystem and Accessibility
MAX is pervasively open source. Its repository hosts a growing collection of models and, notably, features what is touted as the world's largest open-source portable kernel library, supporting NVIDIA, AMD, and now Apple hardware. Modular also provides serving components, making it easier to build and distribute AI servers.

Accessibility is a core tenet, with MAX being easily installable via familiar package managers like `pip` and `conda`. The company also plans to open-source Mojo next year, further cementing its commitment to an open ecosystem. While Modular's immediate focus for MAX is inference, community projects like **Nabla** are already utilizing MAX for both JAX-style and Py

Torch-style training, demonstrating the framework's inherent generality and community potential.

Modular's business model centers on offering a managed cloud platform for AI inference. The licenses for Mojo and MAX are designed for broad adoption, allowing free usage and scaling, with an ask for users to inform Modular of their applications, potentially leading to collaborative opportunities.

## Context

The rapidly evolving AI landscape, particularly with the explosion of **Generative AI**, has highlighted significant gaps in existing software infrastructure. Traditional deep learning frameworks, primarily optimized for model training, struggle to meet the performance and portability demands of **GenAI inference** on diverse hardware. Modular's **MAX framework** addresses this critical need by offering a unified, high-performance, and hardware-agnostic solution. This is vital for developers looking to deploy advanced AI models efficiently, democratizing access to cutting-edge AI beyond well-resourced organizations and accelerating innovation across the entire ecosystem.
