In 1998, they noticed the rise of a new platform called eBay and thought, \"If it worked in the US, why not in Germany?\" So, the brothers went home with a new plan to build their own eBay called Orlando, proving the core idea of the millionaire fast lane, that you don't get rich working for a system, you get rich building and owning a system. And in just 100 days, their platform exploded, gaining thousands of users and listings. It worked so well that eBay bought it for a jaw-dropping $43 million. That win became their blueprint to turn the next big idea into millions fast. Then they launched Rocket Internet, a venture studio dedicated to the art of cloning. And their formula was simple. Duplicate successful US businesses with a proven need. Launch them in foreign countries with low barriers to entry. and then sell them to the original company. Over the next few years, they cloned companies like these, scaled them to market dominance, and sold each for hundreds of millions, making them billionaires from pure borrowed brilliance.",
