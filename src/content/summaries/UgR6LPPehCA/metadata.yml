  _______________________
  Thanksgiving is a good time to ask (and answer) the hard questions.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on how to navigate AI skepticism at the table:
  • Why moral foundations shape every AI objection
  • How to reframe automation fears into augmentation
  • What scarcity vs abundance reveals about water, power, jobs
  • Where LLM “beta” expectations derail real discussions

  The takeaway: operators who engage relatives with curiosity-first framing create far better conversations than those who argue facts alone.
