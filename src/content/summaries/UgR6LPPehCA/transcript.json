  "fullText": "Right now, tutoring's really scarce. Only rich kids get tutoring. But if AI works, we could move to a world where personal attention in education isn't scarce anymore. It's abundant. Anyone can have it. And every kid would get a tutor. And that's messy right now. It's not perfect. But that's the kind of world that we're on the threshold of. And that's what makes me excited. I'll give you one more framework. The beta tester framework. Relatives will often judge AI by the fact that it's currently glitchy or it hallucinates. So judging AI by where ChatGPT was last year is like judging the internet by a dial-up modem in 1994. It's annoying. It's slow. It cuts out when you need it. But we're not talking about keeping this version forever. In fact, we're evolving the version all the time. And that most of the people who talk about it this way haven't tried the latest model. They haven't tried Gemini 3. They may not have tried Nano Banana Pro. And so some of the claims that they make may be based on the idea that it's always going to be this way. That it's just always going to be stuck in beta. And one of the things we can share is that it's it's changing really fast, right? Like it's growing really fast.",
