  "fullText": "Obviously,\nit's all about AI these days for me, I use AI all the time.\nI write a lot of code with AI, I use tools like Cursor and so on,\nbut in this episode, the focus is not on AI. Instead,\nI quite often get the question, which technologies should I learn in 2026\nor which technologies are you, so I, using in 2026?\nAnd that's what I wanna share here.\nI wanna share some technologies frameworks I'm excited about in 2026. And this list is not necessarily\ncomprehensive or complete.\nInstead it's just a list of technologies I personally will be using this year\nand I'm very interested in this year.\nAnd I've talked about it before, there is, course, kind of the default stack\nif we're talking about web development, which I am, which dominates everything,\nespecially with AI or due to AI. And that is, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind. That is AI's favorite and you can see that in the download charts of React for\nexample, and it's the same for Tailwind and the other technologies. And obviously that is, therefore,\nwhat you should definitely learn or use, especially if you wanna find a job. It's not the only choice, of course,\nand I'm not saying Angular, Vue, stuff is bad and it can be a good niche\nto, for example, dive deeper into Vue, but that is AI's favorite,\nthat is the favorite stack of AI. So naturally,\nI'm using some of these technologies also so before AI.\nI'm using TypeScript for all my projects because TypeScript is amazing and yeah,\nit can sometimes be annoying to define more complex types, but for one,\nyou don't need to do that that often, to be honest. And two,\nAI can help with that. AI\nis pretty good at writing TypeScript code advantage of using TypeScript before AI\nwas already that it can help you catch certain errors\nand can lead to higher quality code in the end,\nbut with AI especially, the advantage of using TypeScript is\nthat it's one important building block can give AI useful feedback on whether the\ncode it wrote is valid or not.\nCombined with unit tests for example, or with giving AI browser access with the\nPlaywright MCP or the built in browser in Cursor\nand so on. So TypeScript is something I always used,\nI always liked way before AI but now with AI it's even more\nuseful, so it's part of my tech stack too. The same\nis true for React. I also love Angular, I love Vue.\nI have courses on both and if you've followed me,\nyou know I love all these frameworks has only one favorite framework\nbut over the last years, it's been mostly React that I used for all my\nprojects and especially with AI and with AI knowing so much about\nReact, though I will say it can produce quite garbage React\ncode too with bunch of use of fact and so on,\nbut with all that, React is still part of my tech stack. Next.js has been my main React meta framework for a very long time\nand it's still great. I wanna be very clear here.\nIt's still great, but that's the first new thing maybe, I really like TanStack Start. I've built projects with it,\nlike this Build My Graphic project I built as a side project last\nyear and then I released it. It's a project that simplifies the process\nof generating infographics with AI like this one here,\nwhich shows the finished overview of my favorite\ntech stack and I used TanStack Start for\nthat and I'm also using TanStack Start for other projects\nI'm working on. I'm, for example,\nalso using it for this canvas drawing app you're seeing right here and it's amazing.\nI really like it. I like that it's faster than Next.js\nduring development, that it does certain things differently.\nI like its syntax. I like the simplicity compared to some of\nthe Next.js stuff. There are no use server, use client\nand so on directives and therefore, TanStack Start is definitely one of the\nnew things I started using last year\nand I will continue using this year.\nNow I typically use TanStack Start with Bun for the backend code\nand in general I use Bun for installing packages, for running my code,\nalso the dev server because it's just a faster Node.js.\nI mean simply using it for installing packages with Bun install\nis faster than NPM and I really like Bun. It is, of course,\nNode.js compatible for the most part and it has a bunch of extra things\nbuilt in that can be super useful,\nlike the built in S3 client which allows you to interact with\nthe S3 object store and compatible stores like R2 by\nCloudflare to store objects, images, whatever it is\nand that's built in, package. It's super fast,\nit's faster than the official AWS SDK, for example and yeah,\nfor all these reasons I really like Bun and therefore Bun\nis pretty much my default too in all the projects I'm working on.\nIt's of course not new and it's also not new for me. I've used it last year too\nand even before that but it is my default now so that's definitely\nalso something I'm using a lot.I wanna point out though\nthat Node.js has come a long way too.\nIt's easy to dismiss Node.js as kind of and old and Bun as being much better,\nand I do think Bun is better in many regards.\nBut I wrote an entire article, and you find it linked below in case you wanna\nread it, TypeScript support,\nnative TypeScript support that are built into Node.js that you can use today with\nthe latest versions of Node.js for which you don't need extra packages\nor Bun because Node can do more than many of us think it can.\nAm I still using Bun because I like its speed\nand so on? Yes, I am. But if you're in a project where you need\nto use Node or you just prefer it, it's worth noting\nthat you can do much more nowadays with than a couple of years ago.\nSo modern Node.js is definitely also something I would consider\ntaking a look at again this year if you haven't in a while.\nSpeaking of modern things, I'm also super excited about many modern browser APIs\nand CSS features that are available nowadays because a lot\nhas changed there over the last, I guess, 18 months or so. There\nare a lot of browser APIs and CSS features like,\nfor example, the popover API, but also many others\nthat have reached broad major browser support so you can use\nthem in all those major browsers today.\nYou can use them in your applications of JavaScript code\nor extra packages you would need to otherwise by using these features. Now,\nI created some videos on my other channel, channel,\nwhere I dive into some of these things APIs,\nand I definitely recommend taking a look these videos and these features in\ngeneral. The browser has come a long way\nand there's no need to solve a lot of problems with your own code\nor extra packages that can be solved just by leveraging these new features. And it's worth noting\nthat AI by default might not suggest or use these features because,\nof course, it was trained on data that had all the old code\nbut you can teach it.\nYou can share the documentation, copy and paste it into your prompts\nor share links depending on using,\nand then you can have AI write modern code and that is absolutely something I would\nrecommend doing, that you teach AI all that modern stuff. You really should do\nthat because there's so much you can do here. Now,\nspeaking of AI, of course, we can't entirely skip it in this video\nand I've said it before in other episodes.\nI'm using AI a lot. I write all my code with AI\nand AI writes a lot of code for me. Now,\nnot talking about vibe coding here. I wanna be very clear\nand I know some people will still get it I'm talking about controlling the AI,\nsteering it, providing the right prompts, right context,\ngetting into the code yourself to and really doing agentic engineering as\nit's called. And therefore, of course,\nI work with tools like Cursor. And one tool I'm very excited about this\nyear is OpenCode, for example. There has been a lot of hype about it\nrecently. I started using it back in December so I\nwas cool before it got cool.\nAnd this is essentially an alternative to It's a CLI tool,\na terminal-based coding tool, and you can use it to do agentic engineering\nand it's very nice, has a nice interface even though it's in a terminal,\nhas a lot of features, like agents and agent skills, and yeah,\nyou can really do great agentic engineering\nwith OpenCode. And therefore Cursor\nand OpenCode, for example,\nare other technologies I'm using this year is one I'm very hyped about. Now,\nthere are two things most applications need\nthat you might be building, a database. And for the database,\nmy favorites are PostgreSQL or SQLite. Both are amazing and both\nare of course not new. I'm totally aware of that\nand I know there are more hyped alternatives like Convex and others\nand I might look into those too.\nI haven't really used them to be very But I like these old school databases for\nvery different reasons. Postgres, of course, is very,\nvery popular. It's super performant. When using AWS,\nfor example, you can use managed services like RDS\nor Aurora to make hosting it simple if you want to,\nbut you can also self-host it with Docker. Just need to make sure\nthat you back up stuff and so on. And what's great about Postgres, e-\nespecially now in this modern age is, of course,\nthat it supports all those different extensions like pgvector\nif you wanna have a vector database for building a rag system. And extensions have been there forever,\nthat's not new, but now in the AI age we got new stuff like vector databases\nand you can simply do that with Postgres without using extra\ntools or paying for extra services.\nAnd that's one of the reasons why I really for many of my projects.\nBut for some projects where I wanna keep simpler,\nwhere I maybe don't need those extensions, And in case you didn't know, SQLite\nis really just a file in your project. The database\nis embedded in your code, mean.\nSo there is no extra database server you Instead it's just an extra package you\ninstall or if you're using Bun you don't even need to do that. It has built-in SQLite support so you can\njust use Bun without installing anything\nand you can start writing to the database just a file in your project.\nYou can back up the database by just copying that file somewhere else and\nthat makes it super simple to get started.\nAnd this might sound like something that's or suitable for major projects\nbut you would be wrong. SQLite can scale to-... tens and hundreds of thousands of users\nand thousands of concurrent requests, so it's super scalable\nand powerful. Of course, at some point, you might need more than it, but that point\nis pretty far away and most applications never reach it, to be honest. And then, this simplicity really\nis worth a lot. And it's easy to think of it as a toy\ndatabase but it has lots of features built in.\nIt's an amazing database production projects,\nlike Build My Graphic, for example. It uses SQLite, and therefore,\nthat's another technology I've been using for the last years\nand I'll keep on using, and I'm, still very excited about.\nAnd I (laughs) just wanna do some here because many people think of it as a\ndevelopment only database or anything like that,\nand it's absolutely not. Now, for authentication, it clearly\nis BetterAuth for me. Now,\nthere are many ways of adding and of course, in case you have noticed,\nI'm talking about the JavaScript ecosystem here. But BetterAuth\nis a relatively new library. I mean, it's over a year old already,\nbut it's still not super old. It's extremely well-maintained\nand extremely powerful. It allows you to roll your own\nauthentication without writing any code related to it.\nYou just use this package the auth providers it supports,\nand it makes authentication a breeze.\nIt's the default for all my projects. I'm using BetterAuth for all of them,\nand it's just amazing. And I'll keep on using it.\nI'm still super excited about it, recommend taking a look at BetterAuth\nif you haven't already. So, let me quickly create\nthat infographic I showed you. And whilst that's working,\nlet me be very clear. There's, of course,\nway more interesting stuff happening, way more packages that are worth exploring\nand that I'll be using. For example, if I'm building mobile apps,\nI'll use React Native. This is just a selection of the libraries\nor technologies I'm most excited about\nthat came to my head now that I thought about it. There is absolutely a possibility\nthat I forgot something or that something will, of course,\nemerge over the course of the year already exists but I haven't really used\nit thus far, and of course,\nI'm interested in hearing your thoughts excited about, maybe outside of AI. And obviously, AI dominates everything\nand will have an impact on everything, but it's worth keeping in mind that we,\nas developers, can and should still make choices about\nthe technologies we use and we let AI work on. And yeah, that is a selection of the stuff I'm most excited about.",
