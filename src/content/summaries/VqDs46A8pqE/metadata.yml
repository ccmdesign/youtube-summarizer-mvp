  It doesn't matter how powerful your AI agents are or how autonomous your
  agentic coding workflow has become. One bad command, one hallucination, one
  misinterpreted prompt - and MONTHS of hard work can vanish in an instant.
  Claude Code hooks are your insurance policy against catastrophic, irreversible
  damage.


  🛠️ In this video, we dive deep into Claude Code damage control - the
  essential safety layer every agentic engineer needs. Learn how to set up local
  hooks, global hooks, and the powerful prompt hook that catches dangerous
  commands your agent has NEVER seen before. Whether you're running Opus 4.5 in
  Yolo mode or building production-scale AI agents, this damage control system
  is the armor your code base desperately needs.


  💡 We break down a complete Claude skill installation workflow that makes
  protecting your assets as easy as typing /install. See how the patterns.yaml
  file gives you granular control over blocked commands, ask permissions, and
  path protections. From zero-access paths to read-only restrictions, you'll
  have complete control over what your AI agents can and cannot touch.


  🚀 Key takeaways:

  - PreToolUse hooks for catching bash commands before they execute

  - Prompt hooks that use AI to detect dangerous commands you didn't explicitly
  block

  - Ask patterns that pause your agent and request confirmation for sensitive
  operations

  - Path protection levels: zero access, read only, and no delete configurations

  - Global hooks that protect EVERY code base on your machine

  - A reusable agent skill that installs in seconds


  🔥 This isn't about slowing down your agentic workflows - it's about building
  TRUST with your AI agents. The best engineers don't just move fast; they move
  fast with insurance. Clone the damage control skill, run /install, and never
  worry about your agents destroying your production database or deleting your
  entire repository again.


  Stay focused and keep building.
