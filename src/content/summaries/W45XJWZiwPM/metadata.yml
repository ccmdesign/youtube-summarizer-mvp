  Parallel AI coding agents running in isolated git worktrees. Vibe Kanban is an
  open-source tool for orchestrating multiple AI Agents and fixing issues in
  parallel faster.

  Each agent works on its own feature branch. Spec-driven development with
  human-in-the-loop code review. Full Kanban board for AI task management.


  This video covers the complete parallel coding workflow: creating tasks,
  running 3+ agentic coding sessions simultaneously, inline code review and
  commenting, AI-powered merge conflict resolution, and safely merging branches
  into main.


  Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot and other AI coding agents.
