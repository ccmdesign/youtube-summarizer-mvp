  Gemini 3 has changed the game. In this gemini 3 review, I combine gemini veo
  3, google ai studio tools, and whisk ai into one powerful workflow to build
  professional landing pages with smooth scroll animations.

  Google Gemini 3 powers some incredible experimental tools that most people
  don't know how to use together. Whether you've seen the debates around gpt 5.2
  vs gemini 3 or chatgpt 5.2 vs gemini 3, the real question isn't which model
  wins on benchmarks. It's about what you can actually build.

  In this video, I walk through a complete workflow using Whisk (powered by Nano
  Banana Pro for image generation and Gemini 3 for prompt enhancement), Google
  Flow with gemini veo 3 for video creation, and Claude Code for implementation.
  You'll see how to generate consistent keyframes, create smooth transitions
  between them, convert assets for web performance, and build a polished landing
  page with Hero UI and Motion.dev.

  This isn't vibe coding where you hope for the best. It's a structured approach
  that combines AI tools strategically. While discussions about gemini 3 pro vs
  gpt 5.1 or gemini 3 vs gpt 5.2 dominate AI news, I'm focused on showing you
  practical applications with tools like gemini 3 flash, gemini 3 pro, and
  gemini 3 deep think capabilities through Google AI Studio.

  I also show you how to use 21st.dev for component inspiration and how Claude
  Code automatically adapts components to fit your project without explicit
  instructions.
