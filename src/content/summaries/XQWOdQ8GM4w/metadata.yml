  Your CLAUDE.md file might be the reason your AI coding agent is getting worse over time. In this video, I break down agentic context engineering — a concept from a recent Stanford paper — and explain why it's a smarter alternative to bloating your config files with instructions.
  Most developers keep adding rules and preferences to their CLAUDE.md, thinking more context = better results. But this actually poisons your agent's performance. I'll show you how agentic context engineering uses a RAG-like retrieval system to dynamically pull relevant context instead of stuffing everything into one file. Think of it as fine-tuning without the fine-tuning.
  If you've noticed your Claude Code agent forgetting things, contradicting itself, or just feeling "dumber" than when you started — this is probably why.
