title: 'RE2: The "Stupidest" AI Breakthrough That Actually Works'
description: "Think prompt engineering is about \"taking a deep breath\" or
  \"thinking step by step\"? Think again.

  \r

  Google Research just proved that the most effective way to fix LLM
  hallucinations isn't better wording, it’s repetition. In this video, we break
  down the RE2 (Prompt Repetition) method. We explain why the \"Causal Mask\"
  makes models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 functionally blind, and how a simple
  copy-paste creates a bidirectional \"U-turn\" that boosts accuracy from 21% to
  97% on key benchmarks.

  \r

  Best part? It adds zero latency and works on almost every major model.

  TIMESTAMPS:

  \ * [00:00:00]: Introduction to RE2 and how copying and pasting your prompt
  improves performance.

  \ * [00:00:24]: Explanation of the Transformer problem: Causal masking and the
  physical inability to see the end of the text from the start.

  \ * [00:01:27]: The \"Triangular Prison\" concept in attention matrices for
  models like GPT or Gemini.

  \ * [00:02:22]: The \"Options First\" issue: Why instructions at the end of
  long documents are often ignored.

  \ * [00:02:49]: Formal introduction of Google's research on RE2 (Input = query
  + query).

  \ * [00:03:13]: How double pasting text hacks the system to simulate
  bidirectional attention.

  \ * [00:04:02]: Consistent results across models like Gemini 2, GPT-4o, Claude
  3.7, and DeepSeek.

  \ * [00:04:20]: \"Needle in a Haystack\" (Name Index) test: Accuracy jump from
  21.3% to 97.3% using repetition.

  \ * [00:04:47]: Improvements in general knowledge and complex reasoning under
  the MMLU Pro benchmark.

  \ * [00:05:14]: Mathematical benefits by ensuring the model doesn't
  hallucinate variable definitions buried in text.

  \ * [00:05:49]: Economic advantage: Input tokens are faster and cheaper than
  Chain of Thought (CoT) generation.

  \ * [00:06:38]: Experiments with triple repetition (RE3) for extreme
  difficulty tasks.

  \ * [00:07:08]: Padding test: Proof that improvement is due to information
  availability, not just prompt length.

  \ * [00:07:38]: Recommendations for RAG systems and the importance of
  repeating context.

  \ * [00:07:51]: Conclusion: Shifting from \"whisper engineering\" to math
  based attention engineering.
