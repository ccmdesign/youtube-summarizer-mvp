title: 'I’m a Pathologist: The "Biological Cost" of Ozempic and Mounjaro. '
description: >-
  Miracles don’t exist in biology, mechanisms do. GLP1 medications (Ozempic,
  Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound) are no exception. And every time you override a
  biological system that took two million years to evolve, you are making a
  trade. Every trade has an invoice.

  I’m Dr. Amin Hedayat, a triple board-certified physician and clinical
  assistant professor of medicine. In this video, we move past the media hype
  and fear-mongering to look at the evidence-based truth written inside your
  cells. We are breaking down exactly how GLP-1 medications (Ozempic, Wegovy,
  Mounjaro, Zepbound) work, why they are so effective, and the specific
  biological costs from muscle loss to the "flatness" effect that patients need
  to understand.

  In this video, we cover:

  • The "Evolutionary Trap" that makes modern weight loss so difficult.

  • The Gila Monster discovery that changed metabolic medicine.

  • The difference between Semaglutide and Tirzepatide.

  • The Invoice: The real risks regarding the stomach, anesthesia, and thyroid.

  • The Protocol: How to come off these drugs safely without the "Rebound."
