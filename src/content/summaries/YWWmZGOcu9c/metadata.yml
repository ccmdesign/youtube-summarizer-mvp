  In this video, I share the inside scoop on how to train like an athlete for your career:

   • Why knowledge workers have never had a real practice environment
   • How to build rubrics that turn fuzzy feedback into measurable scores
   • What five skills actually matter when AI handles execution
   • Where team-level practice loops create compounding improvement
