How do you think about your job differently and think about it in terms of skills you can train and improve, preferably with the help of AI? One of my inspirations for this post was a 2019 blog post by Tyler Cohen where he talked about this idea that athletes train and musicians train, performers train, but knowledge workers really don't train. And so I started to ask myself, what does it take to do something like a pianist practicing scales but for knowledge work? And is there a way to start to address this in the AI age that helps us think about skills differently than we traditionally have? Because I got to be honest with you, traditionally our assumptions about skills have been so laded into jobs that it's literally baked into our software, right? It starts with the assumption that you need to layer specific skills into a job post. It's as if we can't imagine a world where skills are something that we acquire because we can use them with AI to get meaningful work done. And yet that is exactly the world we're headed toward.",
