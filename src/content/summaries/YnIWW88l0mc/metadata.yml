title: "Claude Code: 5 Essentials for Data Engineering"
description: >-
  This video is a guide for data professionals (Data Engineers, Data Scientists,
  and Analytics Engineers) on adopting AI for development using Claude Code.


  The main idea: success with Claude Code comes down to managing context and
  memory well. Claude Code works as an agent—it handles multi-file edits, runs
  tests, and fixes errors pretty autonomously.


  The 5 essentials you should understand about Claude Code:

  1. claude.md - Your main instruction file. It tells Claude your project's
  rules, frameworks, and design principles from the start.

  2. Skills - Packages of expertise for specific tasks. Claude automatically
  pulls these in when they're relevant to what you're asking.

  3. Commands - Custom shortcuts you trigger manually (like /my_command) for
  tasks you do repeatedly.

  4. Subagents - Separate sessions for specific jobs (like writing tests). Keeps
  your main conversation focused and uncluttered.

  5. MCP Servers - Plugins that connect Claude to external tools and data
  sources, like Databricks SQL or a companies internal APIs.


  This video also applies these concepts for Databricks projects, but these
  ideas will point you in the right direction for any data platform.
