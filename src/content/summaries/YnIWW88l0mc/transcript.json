  "fullText": "Hey, Dustin Vanoi here. I've been saying lately that AI coding is a big part of the future for data professionals, including data engineering, data science, and analytics engineering workloads. And so, I believe adopting AI for development will become essential. I released a video on cursor a few months ago which uh is talking about working with AI coding agents [snorts] and what the process looks like and it definitely was specific to cursor but has a lot of uh context and opinions that I won't re rehash all of that here but since then I've been digging into this space a lot more and testing out cloud code. Um mostly I'm testing cloud code and cursor because it's a favorite among many developers. It's got a lot of attention right now and so I haven't gone and analyzed everything and come back to you with like this is the best thing ever. Um, but I really do like these two tools and that's what I'll focus on is cloud code today and go back and check out the cursor video if you want to know more about where that fits in beyond the little bit I'll touch on. So what I want to do in this video is focus on cloud code and the most important concepts to master as you get started. Many of these are foundational ideas. They're going to be useful for whatever AI coding tool you use, whether that's cursor, cloud code, or others. Uh, real quick, I want to just say uh yet again, I believe it's not too late to get started with these for the first time. The space is starting to settle a bit for now, and we're gaining a clear understanding of which capabilities are providing the most value. So, while this technology will continue to evolve at a rapid pace, I hope this video can provide a solid foundation on the basics you need to know. I will be sharing a little bit about using cloud code with data bricks and really from a data professional data engineer etc perspective um because I work with data bricks regularly I work in data engineering but I won't go too deep into the data bricks integrations and capabilities yet I'll call out a few things that are good to know and I'll follow up with some more detailed dives into that so this is the part where I ask you to subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications so when I do come out with a more data brick specific video and uh deeper sessions on this you uh know about it and can come in and tune into those as well. So AI enhanced development or AI coding tools focused on cloud code is what this overview is going to be about. Uh big thanks to Robbie Kiss Canyon who's worked with me on these slides, worked with me on the cursor slides and a lot of other learning that I've been doing in this space. Uh many others have been uh helping me to try and get up to speed here. What I'm trying to do is really take what I've been learning from other people on YouTube, from people at my company, and distill it into uh my opinion, my take on kind of the main components you need to know about in order to be effective as a data professional using cloud code. So cloud code is a highly popular tool for AI coding. It's I'd say primarily used through the terminal uh or via extensions to idees. And so uh it uses an agentic approach. By default, you're going to use it through the terminal and it's going to have this approach where you're really letting Cloud Code do a lot of the work for you, right? This isn't just a back and forth chatbot. It's actually making changes across many files uh for your project and maybe your entire system depending on how much access you give it. So if you let the agent or maybe multiple agents develop a significant amount of code, run the test and respond to errors in a directed way, you typically or I see this most often and little bit less back and forth hands-on approach than those that take like the the developer interface uh focused view of it like cursor provides. So, as you may use cloud code from the terminal and have it do a lot of things across your your project for you without really paying much attention to the individual files being changed, there's also a pattern and a common practice where you want to actually see the changes via text editor or via development environment. And so some of the idees that I see very common uh for this are uh really just giving us this ability to structure and track what's going on within our project as cloud code does its thing. First let me talk about cursor. Now cursor is a VS code fork with built-in AI capabilities like code completion um generation and explanation of you know what you have in your project. So you can use it on its own of course but here I'm talking about using it with cloud code as well. And so you might use, you know, cursor for certain things and let it do autocomplete and everything with its built-in capabilities. And then for cloud code, you could have that running from a terminal session within cursor, right, as just another pain within that developer interface. Or you might have a separate terminal, you know, off on a separate screen as a pretty effective way to give you more screen space to work with these tools. Now, others like to actually turn on the extension and have just another pane that's cloud code. but it's a bit more integrated into being able to like highlight which lines within the text I'm looking at right now Cloud Code needs to know about to take its next action. All right, so uh another popular option is Visual Studio Code. This has been really popular uh among developers and so now that there's you know other options to use with it but if you like cloud code you can use the cloud code extension with VS code and get that same type of experience I was describing with cursor other tools other developer interfaces very much have plugins I'd say I've checked on Jet Brains I've used PyCharm a ton in the past Jetrains has a plugin in beta I haven't personally worked with that one so I'm just going to kind of focus on these two as some of the top options day. Now, the key to succeeding with agents is context. Basically, this is the session memory. So, if you think about a computer's memory, if it gets really full and things start to deteriorate, same concept, um very different way it all works in practice, but the same concept here. So, it's about providing the right details and managing the memory so that the agent has the correct information at the right time. So, just remember if your memory gets to a certain point, I think I hear a lot of times either 40 or 60% in that range is kind of where you're starting to get deteriorated results and you may want to start a new session or clear up your session context in some way. So, as we go through this, we're going to be kind of talking about ways that help us manage this context well is really the key. And we're also counting on cloud code to do a lot of context management. Here's the components that we're going to spend time on uh in this session. We're going to talk about the cloud.mmd file for managing memory or putting things in memory explicitly. We'll talk about how skills can give us a lot of capabilities for uh pulling things in at the right time. We'll talk about specific commands that we can have to preset uh like prompts that we want to use. How sub agents can help us break out different workloads and keep that context clear of things that it doesn't need to do a specific task. And then we'll talk about MCPs and really the um ability to have external interaction that is wrapped up in a way that's kind of standardized across all the different types of agents you'll use whether you're using cloud code or something completely different. So first you have your cloud MD. Sometimes in other tools this should be agents.mmd instead. Essentially this is the core information that you want in memory when you start up a new agent session. So, you know, you can have one of these at your user level or do it at the project level. I like to do it at the project level typically. And it's going to define things that are key for your project and are definitely worth having in every time you start up a new session. But you don't want this to be too big or you're going to fill up that whole agent session, uh, fill up that whole memory with this information and you're going to not have space for all the other things you need to do. Examples of things you may have in here are key design principles, things about which tools or frameworks you want to use, maybe a list of references of examples that this project should really leverage to make sure it writes its code effectively in a style that matches what you want. But that's if your whole project is focused on it, if you need this every time. It's not um quite as efficient as if you pull in that information only when you need it, assuming you start different agent sessions throughout the work that you do. One of the popular capabilities at this time is Claude agent skills. This is a way to really package some expertise or guidance on the workflow you want to follow and things that you want your agent to know when doing certain types of tasks. So an example would be one of the built-in skills is a PDF writer. So this is a skill available from Anthropic, the creators of cloud and cloud code. And this is anytime you want to actually write to a PDF this you want this skill to be invoked. Okay. And you don't want to always tell it in your CloudMD file that this is how you do PDFs. You want to only use this at the times that you're doing that type of work. So you essentially want it to uh know a little bit about each of the skills that are available to it, just enough that it knows when to go read in more information into memory and leverage that. And that's exactly how skills are built built to work. So on this image you can uh see that it's got this small block at the top called the front matter and this will always be available to your to your session to know what skills are available and try and figure out when to invoke them. So it's really important to get that concise but also useful for cloud code to figure out when to use it. As you go further down it's going to start pulling in the rest of your skill.md directions uh when it starts to activate that skill. And then optionally, you might have scripts that it uses for references, other markdowns it uses as references depending on, you know, how deep into this certain skill you need to go. So, it's not going to automatically pull in everything as soon as it invokes the skill. That's the main concept that makes these really powerful and uh gives you more options to have quite a few of these within the same project. Uh, a good example would be like a Spark declarative pipelines developer skill. Spark declarative pipelines is a way of creating declarative pipelines with Apache Spark and on data bricks and essentially the APIs have changed a bit over time. The naming has changed over time which leads to a little bit of complications. Beyond that I probably have some like best practices of how I want my team's uh Spark declarative pipelines to look and I can build those into the skill. I think skills are a great place to start getting specific to how your team, your organization is going to do things. you can get really opinionated in skills and then people can tweak those if it's a different team that has their own needs. They can kind of customize the skill more for what they're doing. On the other hand, we have cloud commands. These commands are a way to say when I run / command name, run a predefined prompt. And so you can really control exactly what you want to happen when you invoke it. These aren't going to get automatically triggered or pulled in the way skills might. You will need to choose to run commands by calling slash whatever your command name is. Commands are a great thing to build up when you have certain challenges and the LLM isn't responding the way you had hoped. Uh once you find that in order to like save a better path, a better workflow or a prompt, save that to a custom command that you can always reuse in the future, assuming it's a repeatable task, of course. So, there's some built-in commands that you want to get familiar with. uh you'll probably find them as you go through tutorials or anything else, but you can add custom commands and these can really be helpful for specific things you want to be able to initiate. Now, I want to call out sub agents. I haven't been using them heavily yet. I'm more likely to have two different cloud code sessions going like in a separate terminal tabs, but it's an important concept for you to be aware of and see how it fits for you. Sub agents are a way to split up the work. Sometimes this is so that you can do work in parallel. So sometimes it's so I can have predefined uh specific task and capabilities that will focus on just one type of work. So overall I think of this as a way to get a fresh context a fresh set of memory to focus on a particular task within my larger project. For example, if I want to write a uh group of unit test or refactor a group of unit tests that could be a good sub agent to invoke. It's a task that I could actually do that doesn't need to know everything else in my main uh agent session. Uh it can be kind of its own isolated thing maybe with a couple of skills that it has available without having all of the different um context maybe other tools that are available in the main session. Okay. So, I would say spin up this sub aent, do the test writing, and what you'll see is you can actually do slash agent in cloud code to configure a pre-built sub aent and what um kind of what that agent should be focused on. When we talk about sub aents, an example of a particular sub aent could be something for Spark optimization. Feed it a certain amount of documentation about optimizing. Perhaps you have, you know, a skill that's available to it that's not available to your main session and let it go do its thing. Now, you may be most familiar with MCP, so I saved it for last. MCP is for stands for model context protocol. It's a standardized way for defining a set of tools and handling specific logic related to working with those tools. So, essentially, you have this agent, it has some built-in tools for it. If I want to go work with another external system, a lot of times, you know, I either have to kind of train it to go find the right documentation, write some code, or use a use bash commands like terminal commands to do it. MCP is going to wrap all that up better in a way that's kind of ready to go. So, MCP's been around longer than Cloud Skills has that we talked about earlier, and there's quite a bit of overlap on what these two capabilities could do, which kind of makes it confusing. Quite frankly, one of the reasons it took me a while to get to this video was trying to understand a little more on that. But more on that in a moment, a little bit more about MCP server. That tends to be a good option if I need to work with maybe some internal data or internal systems and there's some special authentication, maybe some sort of state management I need to look up. Uh, and I will need the special interface to work with it, right? uh if I have everything available via easy code snippets that the agent can find already, easy CLI commands, it's less important that you wrap those in an MCP. And so these MCPs really just open up the ability to use a system and use specialized calls from anywhere you're working with agents. So I think the best way to really get into MCP servers is to talk about a few examples on the data brick side. Uh there's actually quite a few different options. Let's talk about a few managed MCPS that data bricks offers for you. You just need to configure it uh within your workspace. Make sure it's enabled and then you'll be able to use these. For instance, uh probably the most popular at least for the types of things I do are to either use a genie space where you've actually wrapped a set of tables maybe with a bit of logic and instructions so that you can have it automatically create SQL and return results to you with a little bit of reasoning around it. In addition, datab brick SQL is uh available via managed MCP. So I can actually submit queries to a datab brick SQL warehouse using this MCP. And it might be a little bit simpler than trying to have it use uh like API calls to submit data brick SQL. I find it's a little bit of a a shortcut to getting to your data brick SQL statements um rather than having it have to run through the API. Now, it kind of depends on how much you want to simplify the different process as to whether you bother having an MCP attached. And part of the reason is that MCPs are going to add a lot more to your context. As I if I have a bunch of different MCP tools available, my context will fill up with those as I use them. And um I'm going to have to kind of be a little bit more diligent about clearing that memory, clearing that context as I go. um potentially if I'm using something like skills, I'll only really need to pull some of that into context when I need it. And so it should fill it up, you know, not as much or definitely not as quickly in every single agent session I start up. So MCPS can add a lot to context. Uh I believe there's some patterns around to try and avoid that and it kind of depends on what uh tools you're using there. But just a heads up that that's kind of where a lot of the debate about do I use skills, do I use MCP servers, do I use these two things together? A lot of it's around this context and um I'm still kind of keeping track of what uh what the arguments and and pros and cons are with those different things. I'll quickly call out a couple of external MCPS that uh me and some colleagues at data bricks seem to be using. Context 7 is one that has up-to-date code examples and documentation. So I might use that to actually go ask it to go use those docs from datab bricks to figure out how to do something the right way and context 7 already has access to all those docs. Another is the playright mcp. If I'm building out like a web application, so with data bricks apps, I might be building out a web application. Now, I can automate some of the web UI checking and have it be able to interpret what's going on in this web UI on the app it just built, which lets it kind of interact better with the more what the finished result looks like versus me having to like take screenshots and paste those in and everything. Another is ML flow, which is a way to interact with certain capabilities that MLflow provides. So you can interact you can interact with MLflow traces programmatically is one example I'm aware of. I haven't used this heavily myself but some of the people more on the data science and ML engineering side have been using this kind of thing. So let's try to break down these different options. I'm not going to get into every detail that's on this slide but if I think about commands remember that's like a specific task I'm going to trigger as the user. I'm going to say I want to trigger this command. And when I'm talking about a skill, that's something that ideally cloud code will know enough information about it and it will just automatically get used when needed through the process. The the skill itself is going to be specialized knowledge for when it's doing a certain type of work. Examples I have for that are a data bricks asset bundle writer skill which would create your CI/CD code for deploying to data bricks. I might have a datab bricks app builder skill to help guide um how to use datab bricks apps specifically and maybe which frameworks and things I want to use within this project. I've actually got a couple different versions of this I'm playing with because there's different ways to build apps, different frameworks to use. So remember skills can have extra information linked to externally or in separate markdown files which will let it sort of build up what's in the memory, what's in the context as that information is needed. In addition, we have sub agents. Remember, those are a way to have standalone workers, so to speak. They can be set up to run in parallel as well. And it's just a way to focus an agent on specific amount of work, get the job done, and then clean itself up rather than keeping everything together in one main agent session throughout the course of your work. Then, MCP servers, probably the most common way to access tools right now. Very powerful. something where you can look at the data bricks managed ones or other external MCPS. GitHub MCP is another example and these will help you get access to tools pretty easily just by enabling MCP servers. My main criticism of MCP servers is that there is a little overhead to either get all of the code set up to where it can run on your local machine or get connected to one if it's not um a managed MCP server that's already enabled for you with some specific, you know, authentication instructions that you need. Point is, you might get stuck a little bit trying to get MCP servers working. I think skills have a tendency because they're relying on the agent so much to not require much setup. It's really just a lot more guidance, information, and references that um your agent can use. And the agent itself, like the cloud code main session is so powerful that skills tend to get you really far. Uh MCP servers can definitely close the gap though on external systems, uh internal tools within your company that just the internet doesn't know about. It's a little bit hard to find and point to the right information all the time. So with that, we've kind of looked at these different components. uh there's some more advanced concepts I think are beyond really uh what you want to know to really get started. So, we're going to cut off this conversation here uh and pick up in the future with more of a deep deeper demo of some of these capabilities and as I start to find more things really useful for me as a data professional um I'll try to come back and share about those or at least put them on my my blog on my website dustinbanway.com. Well, that's a wrap on this video to try and give an introduction to these really important components of Cloud Code and just kind of the basics of how this can be helpful. I hope this really did uh get you started on this path. Um I will like I said follow up with some more detailed um view of some of these different things in action like skills working directly with data bricks in order to help us have more success using cloud code or other agent tools. So, uh, please subscribe to this channel and turn on notifications so that you know about those videos when they come out. If you're interested in other types of data engineering or data bricks focused videos, check out everything else I have on the channel. Uh, thank you. I'll see you next time.",
