## Key Takeaways

Theo addresses the pervasive feeling among developers of falling behind due to the rapid advancements in AI, urging immediate and proactive adoption rather than a wait-and-see approach. He outlines several strategies for both individual developers and organizations to effectively integrate AI into their workflows:

- **AI is now essential:** The time for questioning AI's utility in coding is over; it's proven, powerful, and already writing 70-90% of code for many. Developers are now late adopters, not early ones.

- **Experiment aggressively to find limits:** Start by using the latest AI coding agents (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor with Opus 4.5/GPT 5.2x) to tackle real-world tasks. Push them to their limits, observe their outputs, and use plan mode to understand their workflow. Build personal benchmarks by re-running past projects through AI.

## Summary

Theo, in his video titled "You're falling behind. It's time to catch up," addresses the profound transformation occurring in the programming profession due to rapid AI advancements. He opens by quoting Andrej Karpathy's observation that the programmer's contribution is becoming increasingly sparse, feeling a potential 10x power boost if available tools are properly leveraged. Karpathy likens the situation to receiving a powerful alien tool without a manual, leading to a "magnitude 9 earthquake" in the profession. Theo resonates with this sentiment, recalling the initial rumblings during his GPT-5 video when AI shifted from simple autocomplete to building and maintaining real applications.

He emphasizes that this change is real and accelerating, with many smart developers already using AI for product development or the majority of their coding work. Theo acknowledges that most developers feel like they're falling behind but asserts there are clear paths to becoming more powerful as a result of AI, not less. He believes it is now a developer's responsibility to stay on top of these changes, especially for continued employment, and shares his personal strategies.

### The Shift: AI is No Longer Early Adoption

Theo initially held the belief that it's better to be late than early with most tools, citing examples like Java applets or MCP. However, he firmly states that this no longer applies to AI in development. "The harsh reality is that we are there now with AI," he declares, revealing he writes about 90% of his own code with AI, and teams he advises are at 70% or more. AI, while not great at decision-making yet, excels at discussing them. The fundamental point is that AI is useful, and coding has changed forever. He challenges the notion that AI is too complex for certain tasks, pointing to those building compilers, languages, systems, and even rebuilding core deployment infrastructure with AI. The era of denying AI's impact is over, and it will meaningfully affect the job market.

### How to Catch Up: A Three-Step Guide

Theo outlines a three-step process to catch up and stay ahead in the AI-driven development landscape.

#

### Step 1: Experiment Aggressively and Find Limits

The first step is to actively try the hottest AI coding agents and push them to their limits. He recommends tools like Claude Code, Cursor, or Open Code, using the latest models such as Opus 4.5 or GPT 5.2x. Developers should take a pending feature from a project, ask the AI agent to implement it, and critically read the output, even using "plan mode" if available to understand the AI's thought process. The goal is to build an intuition for what these tools can and can't do, and to increase code output without sacrificing quality.

Theo suggests creating "pseudo benchmarks" by taking a task previously completed manually, cloning the repository to its pre-task state, and having the AI attempt it. If the AI falls short, refine the prompt and try again. If it still fails, save the task and re-attempt it with newer, better models. This method allows developers to compare AI's approach to their own and understand its capabilities and sticking points. He provides an example of building a full image generation studio using Claude Code with Convex and FAL, a task that previously would have taken significant manual effort, now done in one shot.

#

### Step 2: Rewire Your Brain and Think Outside the Box

This step involves a fundamental shift in perception, akin to how a skateboarder views city streets as obstacles. Theo argues that the drastically reduced effort required to write code with AI unlocks a new realm of solvable problems that were previously too time-consuming or complex to justify coding solutions. He shares a personal anecdote of using Claude Code to write a 30,000-line Java

Script file to reorganize and re-encode years of poorly organized personal photos and videos—a task he would never have undertaken manually. Similarly, for his hobby game, he leveraged AI to build an entire suite of asset management tools that would have been "mental illness" to write conventionally.

The core idea is to identify problems that could be solved with code but were ignored due to the effort involved. Now, tasks like automating prose comparisons between models, building Chrome extensions, or creating custom Zsh aliases for repetitive commands become trivial, taking minutes instead of days. This realization, that "any problem that can be solved with software just got a 100 times more solvable," is incredibly freeing and expands the scope of what developers can achieve.

#

### Step 3: Master Orchestration

The final and arguably most advanced step is orchestration—linking different agents, tools, and custom scripts to achieve complex workflows. Theo admits he is still learning this, describing it as the point where things truly accelerate. He provides an example from his game development: creating a "fish bible" (a Markdown file detailing game creatures) that is kept in sync with the game's code by Claude Code, enforcing it as the authoritative reference. This highlights a shift where sometimes it's more efficient to manage projects through high-level descriptions rather than directly reading or writing every line of code.

He encourages experimenting with "slop code"—utility scripts or automations that don't need to meet production quality standards but solve personal pain points. The key, he notes, is to "force it initially" until the click happens, revealing the vast number of tedious tasks now worth automating. Examples include building tools for thumbnail analysis or a Kanban board for AI-generated code tasks. Theo acknowledges that orchestration is challenging, with many new tools emerging, such as Peter's Claudebot, which integrates various tools accessible via an AI agent.

### Organizational Strategies and Future Outlook

Theo references a post by Raul, Head of Applied AI at RAMP, which details an "AI leader playbook" for organizations. Key recommendations include:

- **Empowering engineers with coding agents:** Provide choice of harnesses, models (Claude Code, Cursor, Devon with Opus 4.5 as baseline).

- **Giving agents access to all dev tooling:** Integrate with Linear, Git

Hub, Data

Dog, Sentry, and internal tools to provide necessary context. An example showed RAMP's internal "inspect bot" creating 20 PRs to fix common Sentry issues.

- **Investing in codebase-specific agent docs (Agent MD):** Improve prompting, linting, and code rules. Agents learn from feedback; typed languages significantly help by allowing error feedback for self-correction. The Claude Code team reportedly updates their Agent MD multiple times daily.

- **Robust background agent infrastructure:** Set up VMs and sandboxes for engineers to run multiple agents in parallel, anticipating code review as a future bottleneck (and suggesting AI code review tools like Grapile or Code Rabbit).

- **Addressing security:** Unblock access to these tools, even for earlier-career engineers, by managing risks rather than avoiding AI entirely.

- **Always using the latest models:** Move off older models quickly unless robust evaluations prove otherwise, as frontier models typically offer significant upgrades.

- **Leveraging embedding semantic search:** Replace fuzzy search heuristics for better context retrieval within AI tools.

- **Structured outputs and unstructured inputs:** Use structured outputs for pre-filling forms and allow free-form text/documents on all product surfaces, as "forms are dead."
- **Abandoning custom fine-tuning:** The frontier models are improving too fast; better prompting is more effective and cost-efficient.

- **Building lots of evaluations (evals):** Create simple benchmarks to compare models and make quick upgrade decisions, driven by Pareto cost vs. performance plots.

- **Encouraging AI use and reducing inference spend worry:** Leaders should foster AI adoption across engineering teams and understand that inference costs are dropping rapidly, making spend less of a concern than the productivity gains.

Theo concludes by advising individual contributors (ICs) to find every opportunity to use these tools, even if it means "sneaking" them into their workplace. He advocates for an "ask forgiveness, not permission" approach, suggesting that being fired for pushing AI adoption could even lead to better job opportunities at forward-thinking companies like RAMP. He stresses pushing limits—of the tools, of personal capabilities, and of workplace resistance—as the path to significant productivity gains and career advancement. He also directly addresses managers, warning that prohibiting AI tool usage will lead to losing the best developers and ultimately company failure. He offers no clear path for students but encourages building, shipping, and pushing limits.
