  📉 Trading App Lagging? Let's Fix the Connectivity!

  The Scenario: A financial services firm is moving their real-time trading app
  to a hybrid cloud, but they can't afford a single millisecond of lag.


  The Challenge: How do you guarantee sub-10ms latency and zero jitter while
  ensuring your backup link is fully encrypted? 🔒


  The Solution: AWS Direct Connect + Site-to-Site VPN 🎯


  - Primary: Direct Connect for that dedicated, private "express lane" that
  bypasses the messy public internet.


  - Backup: Site-to-Site VPN to provide an encrypted failover that keeps
  compliance happy without breaking the bank.


  This is the "Classic Hybrid Pattern" every Solutions Architect needs to
  master! 🏆


  👆 Watch the full breakdown to see why VPC Peering and CloudFront won't cut it
  for this use case!
