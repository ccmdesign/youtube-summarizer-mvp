  "fullText": "Last year was a record-breaking year for cyber security, and not in a good way. More than 48,000 CVEes were published last year, and it's officially the highest amount of vulnerabilities discovered in a single year. And it seems that things are not going to get any easier going forward. In this video, let's take a deeper look at the statistics to figure out why is the number of vulnerabilities surging and what we can do about it. So, vulnerabilities were up last year by 18% and that means there were on average 130 new security flaws discovered every day of the year. What's even scarier is that in early 2025, roughly 28% of observed exploits were launched within one day of the vulnerabilities disclosure. That means that by the time developers issued a patch, the attackers were already actively exploiting and targeting systems. And needless to say, AI coding has made it even easier on both fronts. With vibe coding on the rise, this opens new systems up to unseen vulnerabilities because of weaker security measures put in place by the AI coding agents. And on the attacker side, it's never been easier and faster to scan a system for critical issues and to quickly generate a script that could actively exploit these newfound vulnerabilities. But when looking at the types of exploits, surprisingly enough, cross-sight scripting and SQL injection are still one of the most popular attack vectors. So implementing a proper input sanitization on your apps or systems is one of the easiest things you can do to protect yourself. And if we're talking about specific web frameworks, WordPress still remains the highest source of newly discovered CVEes with around 7,000 new vulnerabilities discovered on WordPress alone. So, I would caution to stay away from WordPress. But if you do plan to use WordPress for your next projects, make sure you use as little plugins as possible because the vast majority, 90% of WordPress related bugs come from third-party plugins and another 6% from themes and only 4% come from the core WordPress software itself. So, the WordPress core is relatively secure, but plugins are usually poorly maintained and some issues might get neglected. But this brings up a good point. Which languages and which frameworks are relatively secure? Well, the data shows that on average memory safe languages like Rust, Java, Go, C, Python, or Swift are considered more secure than memory unsafe languages like C, C++ or assembly because these languages allow direct pointer manipulation. And research shows that roughly 70% of all high severity security vulnerabilities in large code bases like those at Microsoft and Google are caused by memory safety issues. And a major shift in 2025 has been the aggressive push by organizations like CISA, the NSA, and the White House for developers to move away from memory unsafe languages. It's also worth looking at code density when assessing vulnerability risk because Google's 2025 data indicates that Rust code has a vulnerability density of 0.2 per million lines of code compared to nearly 1,000 per million lines of code in historical C or C++ code. And this makes total sense because C and C++ has been around since the 70s and they have a lot of historical code that still carries potential unpatched vulnerabilities. So if you were wondering whether to choose C or Rust for your next project, this fact alone might tip the scale much more in favor of Rust just from a security standpoint alone. And if we look at operating systems, then by far the most vulnerable operating system is the Linux kernel. And this isn't really surprising because as we know the Linux kernel is ubiquitous. It's powering servers, Android, IoT devices amongst other things, and it has been heavily scrutinized by researchers. So, lots of bugs have been found and disclosed. Plus, any open- source project is bound to garner more attention from potential attackers. So, as we head into 2026, the question is, what can we do to better prepare ourselves and protect our systems from upcoming threats? Well, the reality is that we are no longer just fighting human hackers. We're entering an era of machine to-achine warfare. So, here are three pillars of security you should focus on this year. One, prioritize memory safety. For all new development, prioritize memory safe languages like Rust, Go, Swift, or others. And transitioning away from C and C++ is the most effective way to reduce your vulnerability density. Two, implement AIdriven monitoring. Since attackers now use AI to launch exploits within 24 hours of disclosure, manual oversight is no longer sufficient. You should deploy automated detection systems that use behavioral analysis to identify anomalies in real time. And a great monitoring tool for these types of detections is BetterStack. Better Stack now has AI native error tracking built into it. And it even includes an AIS SR that can alert you any time of the day when something in your system goes wrong. And third, minimize the supply chain surface. This lesson applies to all modern development. Reduce dependencies. Most vulnerabilities stem from third-party plugins and libraries. This was especially noticeable with the vicious React to Shell exploit last year on which James did an excellent deep dive which you can watch right over here. And finally, the fourth thing you should do is subscribe to our channel to make sure you don't miss any updates on new critical vulnerabilities. We try our best here at the Better Stack channel to keep you up to date with the latest developments and that includes addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities. So, I hope you found this video useful and if you did, then make sure to let us know by smashing that like button underneath the video. This has been Andress from Better Stack and I will see you in the next videos.",
