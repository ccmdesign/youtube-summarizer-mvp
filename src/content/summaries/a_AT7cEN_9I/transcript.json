  "fullText": "of Planetator. It's a Claude code plugin that hooks into planning mode. I'm going to ask Claude to create a test plan. Um, typically Claude would launch itself into plan mode while it's working with you or you would put it into plan mode if you had a spec for a new feature. Um, in this instance, it's just demonstrating how plan mode normally works. And the unique part about our plug-in is that we through hooks capture um the plan as it's created. So here we captured it and planet planetator gives us a nice way to view the hook. Sorry, gives us a nice way to view the plan. Normally we have to review here and then type out um the things we want. But with planetator I could come in and I could say no we use PNPM instead. Um you know I could have easily given Claude that feedback. Um but it's nice because I could iterate over entire code blocks. Um I could add all sorts of annotations or other comments. What's also cool about planetator is I could share this plan privately because we compressed the plan similar to text area.mmy into a base 64 that fits in the URL. This is simply a static site where I can share that and I might be able to share this plan with my colleagues to get their feedback and get their annotations. So a CL colleague might be able to catch things in the plan that I missed and those are added and then I would share that back. Um otherwise I could provide this feedback to claude and it would deny the plan or approve it. So feedback was sent as we can see the plan was denied by permission request and that's planetator.",
