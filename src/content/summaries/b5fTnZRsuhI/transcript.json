  "fullText": "I think you want to invest in people that can materialize labor, capital, and customers. We either want to buy any percent any percent right of something that is absolutely working or high ownership of something that could work. >> $15 billion. That is how much Andre Horowitz just raised. Today I'm joined by Alex Rampel where he leads their $ 1.7 billion apps fund. >> The best companies have hostages, not customers. In 2025, the ability to go create a software product is so easy. This can take weeks, which is bonker. The battle of every startup versus incumbent is whether the startup gets the distribution before the incumbent gets the innovation. Right? So probably of the unicorn class, I would bet that maybe 5% will ever be able to go public. If you win 100% of the deals, that's a very very good sign. But if you're winning them with very low ownership, you're probably not testing how far you can go. The entire job of venture capital is to find, pick, and win investments. If they're good investments, the winning is very, very hard. We are buying out of the money call options and we hope they expire in the money. I don't necessarily think you could take it as a given that a small fund will outperform a large fund. Ready to go. Alex, dude, it's been eight years. I'm hoping that my question asking ability has gone up in terms of quality in those eight years. Now listen, I want to start $15 billion you raised today and I was just looking at that and I was wondering in an age of venture today, do you have to go really big or go crafts and very small and boutique to win in venture today? >> Yeah. I mean I think th this is um this sounds like a bad word when I say death but there is this kind of death of the middle that happens to a lot of asset classes in general and venture capital Apple it was a tiny tiny asset class at the beginning um right now it's gotten bigger but it's really more of the end state of a lot of these companies is huge I mean Sequoia used to brag about I think it was like 20% of the market cap of the NASDAQ was Sequoia companies millions of like you know Apple and Oracle and all of these these amazing names um they're very very big, right? And companies go public much much later today. So, the ability to deploy more capital, more money into kind of venture capital, which is no longer um you know, kind of sidetrack here. Series D didn't exist in like 1992, right? It's like that was an IPO. Like companies would go public. I think Amazon went public at like a $600 million market cap or something like that was the norm. There was no series I, series K, series, you know, W. you would just go you'd raise you know series A raise series B raise series C then go public um and consequently venture firms back then were very very small but also the exits tended to be quite small as well right like if if if a very very good scenario is you have a company it goes public at a sub billion dollar market cap it's like and you get five of those a year like you you can't raise lots of money but now the opportunity is so much bigger the five biggest companies on earth are all technology companies if you rewind 20 years I think they were all banks. If you rewind 10 years before that, there were all oil companies. If you rewind rewind 10 years before that, there were all Japanese companies during like the Japanese stock market bubble. But, you know, the opportunity in technology is so much bigger, especially because these companies you you can you could keep investing venture capital dollars later. Like I think that's one of the main if you look at the money that we just raised, you know, almost 7 billion of that is for the growth fund. And >> David George has got a big appetite, you know, and Alli's raising a series T as we speak. He's going through the whole out. >> But this is the point. It's like if companies went public after the series B back in like the 1990s and like the average IPO is 50 to$100 million of capital raised, you know, the the the strategy would be a little bit different, but the world has changed dramatically and the opportunity size is so much bigger and now you have technology companies that kind of pervade everything. It's like you're either if you if you are a large company today and you don't use software at your core, you're going to get eaten by somebody who does use software at their core and then kind of reverse engineers into whatever product or service that you promote. Every LP says the canonical wisdom and the theory of venture as you scale performance goes down. Do you legitimately think then that with the expansion of these markets you can maintain 5x plus net funds at scale? Well, I think the difference though is that imagine that you're an LP and you have a billion dollars to invest. Would you rather get would you rather invest $50 million and get a 5x on that or would you rather invest all billion and get a 3x on that? And the answer is you'd rather get a 3x on a billion than a 5x on, you know, 5 million. Or um one of my good friends is this guy Mickey Mala at Ribbit. I was lucky to be an investor in his fund one personally. And it's like that was like a 55x fund um on I think it was like an $85 million fund, but 55x like that's insane. But you know at some point um you can ask Mickey this too. It's like you're better off with like a 5x on like a very very large fund. Like the harder thing to do is to just return gross dollars uh period. Like that that's what LPs actually want. It's amazing to get a 100. Like I've I've had two funds that I've invested in. One is Mickey. This other one is this fund called Angel Pad which was uh kind of like a third rate competit. I don't want to call it third rate but it was like it was not you know there was Y Combinator and then it's like there was Angel Pad. It was just like this this small little experiment that was 120x. I got 120 times the capital that I get DPI. >> How big was the fund? >> I think it was $8 million. >> That's impressive. >> But but this is the thing. It's like that's incredible. Your point is very valid. Like can you get $120 on a $2 billion fund? Probably not. I'm I'm I'm willing to uh to bet you that you can't get 120x on that. But you can return far more dollars if you're very very good at this is the question that you originally asked was and this is why I called it the death of the middle. Like my view is most asset classes you either have to be a large generalist or a small specialist. And the hard thing is to be like a midsize generalist because then you're largely going to lose to like the big generalists or the small specialists. So like you know Ribbit um as an example like they really focus on fintech. That's how I know them well. Like that's a specialty. They're not trying to do everything. Or um Kazak in Latin America like they are focused on a specialty. Um, and they can be small. Like they're not trying to do everything across the entire planet because a lot of like the entire job of venture capital is to find, pick, and win investments. If they're good investments, the winning is very very hard. And the winning therefore goes to the person that is like the be like you you have to sell. Like this is a sales job. You know this, right? Like it's like you have an entrepreneur. They're amazing. They don't come along very often. This is the best entrepreneur you've ever met. You have to convince them to take your money. And how do you do that? You have to say I am the greatest person in the world to help you which means I have this amazing specialty and or and this is why it's not just or it's and or I have all these things that I can do for you. I'm connected to everybody on the planet given the scope and scale of my kind of general generalization right like on the big side. If I'm just like hey I kind of do a little bit of everything and I don't really know that much about your business and I'm not that big and can't help you that much. It's just you're going to lose. That's why the death of the middle is what tends to happen for a lot of these asset classes like um and then LPs, you know, they want to chase returns. Um it's also sometimes hard to reach LPS. So like, you know, the big generalists kind of gobble them up or the small specialists that that generate very very good returns will will gobble them up as well. >> I have so many things to say. The first thing I do just want to say is Mickey Malca. mentioned Mickey when I was 18 helped me and agreed to be a mentor of mine 12 years ago when it was completely not obvious. I had no idea why he spent time with me and he's been incredible to me ever since. He always taught me you're never won or lost. You're only ahead or behind. Keep playing >> and I love that. Um you mentioned there about kind of the scale of dollars and actually wouldn't you rather do two 5x on 250 than I don't know 15x on 10 or whatever it is. Um, yes, but there's an opportunity cost of dollars and for an endowment fund, they are able to put it into the smaller fund. And so, do you accept with that then that you just scale out of certain LPS and it's no longer the best risk adjusted place to put money then? >> Well, I bet I I I think it's a obviously you can't you can't disprove a an an unknown future. Um, but I would pause it to say that if you were trying to find, pick and win the best deals, and maybe you disagree with me. I'm like the kind of the small specialist, um, or the large generalist, but who wins the best consensus deals? Every now and then there will pop up a non-conensus deal that everybody thinks is terrible. Nobody wants Sequoia doesn't want to do it. We don't want to do it. You don't want to do it. Nobody wants to do it. Um, and then it ends up being a thousandx and then somebody who is not the best known venture firm, you know, ended up winning that deal or being being sold that deal, I should say, and then it ends up with a with a great return. But a lot of the best deals will go to the best firms. Like that's what's very different about venture capital than like private equity. Like if if you and I are trying to take a public company private, you know, you're KKR and I'm Blackstone, we're both trying to, you know, take over RJR and Aisco or something like that, they're just going to sell to whoever offers them the highest price per share. I mean, they have to. Whereas in venture capital, as you know, you have to win the hearts and minds of the entrepreneur and win that deal. And a lot of the best deals are somewhat obvious. Like it it's not surpris like everybody wanted to invest in Uber, everybody wanted to invest in Facebook. like it was self-evident that these were very very interesting companies. May maybe when the price gets high enough there there come some doubts in people's minds like I don't know if I want to invest at 87 million pre for the series A of Facebook but everybody wanted to do it at 20 million pre. There are a lot of companies that people don't want to do at any price. But the reason why I'm saying this is I I don't necessarily think you could take it as a given that a small fund will outperform a large fund. Um, now I think it has the capability mathematically like again if you're if you're Mickey and you invest in the series A of Coinbase and you have a very very very small fund, of course you can generate a bigger multiple of that fund. Like that that's just, you know, algebraically true, but the best deals in fintech like Mickey gets to do them because he's a great firm. Um, and he has a much much bigger fund right now. So I that that's the thing that I think it's hard to know. I mean it's like again I agree with you algebraically but I I would put my own personal money and I do right. It's like I invest in our funds like I would put my own personal money in funds that have you know kind of uh the small specialist or the the big generalist because I think that's where the best returns will be. >> Can I ask you when you think about the best returns what is the multiple of your best return give or take >> for a single deal there's a seed deal that I did that uh it's probably marked up at like 200x right now. you said about consensus deals and I immediately thought of actually an Andrees deal which is like 11 Labs which was the most non-consensus deal ever at seed where it was like you're competing with open AI you're in London it's a preede it was very non-consensus when you look back at your best deals have they been consensus or non-consensus >> well I think but if you look at 11 the entrepreneur was pretty consensus like it's like all right Mart's super like that whole team team is incredibly talented. >> Sure. But the preede and the seed a lot of people turn down. >> Yeah. But I I think our job and you know and I say are right. Your job is tell me if you agree with me is we find the smartest people in the world that have very high agency. Like there's been this thing going around about agency. I love this term. Right. It's like agency. How do you define it? It's like people will they're not going to be told what to do. They just take matters into their own hands. This is a very rare trait, right? Like you obviously had this trait when you could have just done the the normal thing for a 19-year-old to do or however you were you you were younger than that when you started 17. Yeah. >> Yeah. It's like what you did is not normal, right? Like you you had agency and said I am going to not do the normal thing. I'm going to go like email every famous VC to death and get them to talk to me and like you know it's pretty incredible what you've done. That's a very rare trait. You find people like that that are hopefully experts in their domain. Um and I think that this is why the specialty thing that I mentioned is very very important. I believe that um there is a certain level of consensus around who has agency and who is an expert in the domain. Like if you if you talk to an amazing entrepreneur, it's like wow, this person knows everything about this. They've studied it for decades. They've read every book about it. They've talked to every entrepreneur who's tried this before. You have to give them money. That's our job. Our job is to find these people, give them money. It won't always work for sure, but I I I actually don't agree that 11 was a non-conensus deal. Like if it was a high enough price, uh if it was not a seed, if it was like, okay, it's a series B, they have half a million dollars in revenue and it's shrinking every month. Yeah, of course it's not going to be consensus, but like I'm an entrepreneur. >> That was going to be my question, which is like at what stage does that no longer hold true? You know, the series A partner who leads our series A fund is like gh the seed guys have it easy. you know, amazing founder, great, let's roll the dice. For us, it's not quite enough. There comes that series. Is it the >> No, I agree. Like, at some point, reality, it converges with reality. And if if my my kids and I have been watching Silicon Valley, the show, and like there's that famous scene where it's like, wait, you like they got, you know, the the Mark Cubid character is on the phone and he hears revenues. No, no, you can't do revenue. You have to be pre-revenue because then you're a pure play, right? It's like, so there is this element. I mean the the way to explain this financially is we buy out of the money call options. You know what a call option is, right? We are buying out of the money call options and we hope they expire in the money because this is how I explain to people like why it is that a series A that has a million dollar in revenue and is losing $10 million a year is, you know, worth $100 million. Of course, it isn't worth $100 million. What you're doing is you're buying 15 or 20% of the company and hoping that eventually your call option expires in the money. Like that that's that's the thing that you're doing. So once you eventually that value converges on like the equity value. It's like oh what's the discounted cash flow blah blah blah blah blah like once it gets closer there and it's not a binary thing right like at the seed it's like okay out of the money call option this guy or gal is very very smart. I want to buy 20% of whatever they're doing and hopefully it expires in the money and like they're the smartest person I've ever met. Like we do those deals 100 times a day. We will do them 100% of the time right? consensus non-conensus like there isn't really anything to be consensus or non-conensus on right it's just like this is a very very smart person it only becomes non- consensus to your point when the price goes up high enough because I think most people have the same viewpoint of this is a very very high agency person who has studied history like there's a there's a memo that I wrote internally for our firm about how to invest in people and I think you want to invest in people that can materialize labor capital and customers especially today where people had paid a fortune to stay at OpenAI or Anthropic or Meta or any of these companies. If you quit your job to start a company and you can snap your fingers and five people follow you tomorrow for a 50% pay cut, that's pretty magical. Like that doesn't happen every day. So that's the materializing labor. You also want to make sure this kind of goes into the consensus non-conensus part like is this person really good at fundraising? Like are they telling a good story? Can they convince people like me to give them money? Oh wow, they really can. That means hopefully that n+1, n plus2, n plus3 rounds will be a little bit easier. They will converge on reality in terms of numbers for sure, but they have the the thing around raising money. And then this is more of an enterprise focused thing, but can they get their first five customers, which is as hard, if not harder than getting their first five employees because um you know kind of imagine this company Toast, you know Toast, it's the restaurant POS company. >> Yeah, I love them dude. I'm a vertical SAS nut. This is like >> Oh, I know. I I love vertical sess, right? So, like imagine that that you're Chris at Toast. You start this company and you go to a restaurant and say, \"Hey, I want you to use my my product.\" And the restaurant asks some very good questions like, \"Okay, well, how much cash do you have left?\" It's like, \"I have a week.\" Okay, interesting. How many other customers do you have? Zero. Like, that's impossible. How can you pull that off? If you are this rare breed of person that can materialize labor, capital, and customers, um, and then I have kind of two sub appendages after that. I really really like people that have studied the history of the space and and I say this because the best entrepreneurs that I've met, they have learned everything about the space and um I uh to show what a great investor I am, when I was a when I was running my company, Trial Pay, I met with uh I think I think Patrick Callison, I know a lot about payments. I've been doing like payment stuff since 1997 on the internet, which is which is kind of early stages uh for for internet online acceptance of credit cards. meet Patrick and uh obviously I passed on doing the seed round of of Stripe because I'm a genius. It was called dev payments at the time. I was not in the Dre and Horwood so don't hold it against me. Uh it didn't hurt our DPI and and luckily the firm invested in them. But two things you know I asked Patrick you know where are your customers going to come from because everybody uses Chase payment. It's like oh my customers don't exist yet. It's like the stupidest answer I've ever heard but obviously it was genius. Um but but number two what really did impress me is that you know he knew everything about the history of the payment systems. I mean, I think I think he actually went out to go meet Dehawk, the founder of Visa. Um, John Collison gave me a book on like, you know, one of those Springer yellow, you know, academic textbooks on the origins of the payment system. Like just they had studied history so much. Same thing for Vlad at Robin Hood. Studied history so much. Same thing for a pervad at Instacart like you know went out to go meet the founders of Web Van. This is a very very classic trait. On the other side, I will meet people that will start a company almost exactly like Trial Pay or almost exactly like a firm. And I know a lot about these two companies because I started them, right? Um, and they're like, \"Oh, what what was Trial Pay?\" Or, \"Oh, I had never heard of this.\" And it's like, \"Come on, man. Like, how are you're going to spend 10 years of your life building this thing, and you really should study history?\" Brian Chescuit Airbnb studied everything about, you know, bed and breakfast and hotel industry in the 1800s. Like, this is a very, very classic trade. So, so let me just finish with this. So, so again, labor capital customers study history. And then my favorite book of all time is the count of monorristo because it's a story of revenge. And the reason why this is so important, um, if you know the book, it's by Alexander Duma. Um, Edmund Dantes is wronged. He's sent to prison uh, for, you know, bogus reasons for supposedly being a Napoleon supporter for like 17, 18 years. Uh, eventually gets out, becomes the richest person in the world, but doesn't give a [ __ ] if I can use that language. just does not care. He wants revenge. Like he wants to destroy his enemies and just like conquer the world or just really destroy his enemies. And you need that kind of motivation because going back to fun size, if somebody offers you $100 million and you're an 18-year-old kid, that is transformative. You'd have to be an idiot to turn that down or you have to want revenge or redemption. Revenge redemption kind of same thing. And I find a lot of the best entrepreneurs, they have that going like they want to prove they're better than everybody else. They they had some childhood chip on their shoulder or you know they were wronged at their last company, you know, like Dave Duffield has this hostile takeover of Peopleoft. Of course, he starts workday and he's like, \"Fuck you, Larry Ellis.\" Like there there's always that kind of energy. So the catam monorris Christo thing I I don't know how to describe it but like the motivation has to be beyond just like I want to make $50 million because if that's the motivation and that's great motivation you know I'm a capitalist like we live in a capitalist society if that's the only motivation like it's not going to work for our fund size. So like we we want I I love seeing that that fire and and again like a lot of the most successful companies that I've seen they always have that like Renault Lelanch starts Lending Club fired from his own company. He's made tons of money doesn't give a [ __ ] He starts a competitor called Upgrade. No no no no accident that the company is called upgrade. It's like an upgrade over you mfers, right? Like starts an up start starts upgrade. Upgrade has a multiple of the market cap. It's probably like worth 10 times more than Lending Club now. So that that's a very very classic commonality. My question to you, I want to stage the questions there because there was so much to unpack. You said there about kind of you love them studying history and you said about passing on Stripe. That was my concern which is there is a level where you can know too much and so like I think I know quite a bit about lending now. I know beginners beginners compared to you but I know quite a bit about lending where it's quite easy for me today to see a lending business and go [ __ ] horrible. It's a hard market. I don't want to be there. Look at Lending Club. Look at the market cap there. very dismissive as many were with Stripe when they knew payments. How do you prevent yourself knowing too much that it's a negative? >> I think this is a great question and this is the number one thing that that so I do a couple things. Number one, if it's like an adtech company, I know a lot about ad tech. I know a lot about payments. I will force somebody else to join me for the pitch that is like a beginner's mindset mind. Um, so I think that's one is just like have a sparring partner internally that has that, you know, what if it works? you always have to be like what if it works. So that's number one. Number two is I I like to ask the entrepreneurs like what is different and the thing that's different like the the way that Patrick the reason why Patrick um and John made Stripe work partially is it's like they just believed that a great number of new companies will be created and they're going to pick the best product and they're going to have the best product. And actually this informs a big part of my investment thesis now. I mean, I call it green field, but um there's a saying that I use a lot, which is the best companies have hostages, not customers, right? It's like you'll appreciate this if you're an enterprise SAS guy, right? It's like the best companies have hostages, not customers. So, if there's a company that has something marginally better than Workday, right? They're not going to go like Workday has hostages. They don't have customers. They're not going to go be able to sell GE and say, \"Oh, wow. I love you two YC kids. like I'm totally switching my HIS from shitty workday to amazing you know AI whatever YC Silicon Valley HIS never going to happen but if the rate of new company creation is high enough those new companies will pick the best product and they're like oh wow I could use Workday but I'm not a hostage so I'm free I'm going to pick this other thing like I I was the first investor in Mercury um the uh the the SMB bank and like until SVB failed I don't think They they they never stole a customer from SVB. Like, but if you're a brand, as long as the rate of new company creation is high enough, you can play this game that I called green field bingo where it's just like you pick every software category, you build a better version of that and then you've got a shot. And that's what Stripe was, right? I mean, like that's why it worked. If the rate of company creation is very low, like if I build a better EHR, like electronic health records company, um it's just not going to work because the rate of new hospital creation is too slow, right? It's it's like you can't just you can't just sell to the new companies, but you can do that for payment processing, right? You can do that for ERP, like you do it for a bunch of other categories. So, you will look for green field bingo markets where the rate of net new companies being created will supplant the slow slow sales cycles of the larger enterprise customers who will eventually switch. >> Or maybe they don't, right? It's like who cares if they switch or not? Like it's like they'll hopefully die because they're using shitty software. um like that the fact that they won't switch is actually indicative of like their mantra on everything. Like they want to use old technology or they're hostage to old technology. Let's just sell into the future. And you know, betting on the future is more fun. I mean, like one of the things that's very very challenging is you go start a company, you recruit 10 hot shot people from Meta, Google, whatever, and then they're bored to death. Why are they bored to death? Because they can't do anything. It's like they were used to making little tweaks that a billion people experienced every minute, every hour and now they're at a startup and the startup it's been one and a half years and they've made one sale and that's that's quite t and then like you end up losing your talent because it's boring like you can't actually do anything. So, you know, it's nice to have these markets that can ramp quite quickly and you kind of want the market to be a tailwind for you. It doesn't mean that there's not value in kind of creating big companies that sell big, you know, startups that sell, you know, big software products to big companies. You can do that. It's just it's a much much harder thing culturally for Silicon Valley. I think >> shows are a bit like venture, which is the majority that you do are actually not very good. And then you get the once in a while episodes like this, which remind you why you love what you do so much. You know what I mean? When you meet that special founder. So great when you have a show like this. My question to you is you said hostages not customers. How should I think about that then in a world of cursor or any of the foundation models your anthropics or your open AIS where they are customers not hostages they can switch very easily. The promiscuity of customers has never been higher. How should we think about that? >> It's it's a really good question. I mean, I think this is where behind every technology revolution and kind of go back to like silicon, then the personal computer, then the internet, then kind of internet 2.0 where you could write to the internet things like things like Facebook and uh and YouTube, then mobile, then cloud. There's always been an infrastructure layer and an application layer. So, you know, you go back like the infrastructure layer for PCs was, I don't know, like Microsoft and Apple, like the operating system players. The infrastructure player for the internet was like Cisco and Alami. um the infrastructure player for everything AI are all of these back-end model you know providers and then there's the application layer on top so if I do you know we were talking about ask Leo right like that's an application layer company they I mean if I were Vlad I would love to be promiscuous with all the backend models because I should be and then the infrastructure players are like oh [ __ ] you know all of our customers are being promiscuous let's figure out how we specialize in a particular area I imagine that like that's why anthropic I imagine has gotten very good at coding. Um, but it's kind of the application layer tends to be a little bit stickier, but the problem is you might have 9,000 competing companies at the application layer, in which case you'd rather be the infrastructure layer, but the infrastructure layer is pretty hotly competed as well right now. So, I don't know. I mean, it's I think the the the more relevant question for me is in 2025, the ability to go create a software product is so easy. I I published this chart with the help of of my friend Chad GPT of um how long it took VisiCal which was the first spreadsheet that came out in 1979 to lose to Lotus 123 and then how long it took Lotus23 to lose to Microsoft and it took about 5 years from VisiCal to go from 100% market share because they were 100% market share because they were the only one in the first to 50% market share. It took about 15 years after that for Lotus which had you know 70% market share in 1986 or something to almost zero. Um these this would normally take a long time. In 2025 this can take weeks which is bonkers right because all of these layers of past innovation have kind of like almost like a Russian nesting doll kind of concentrically grown against each other. So because you have cloud and because you have mobile everybody in the world has a smartphone in their pocket. All of those smartphones are connected to like, you know, infinite computing in the cloud or near infinite computing with with like a a der of energy in the cloud. And now I build something marginally better. I can get into the hands of a billion people overnight. And that's just so so different. But I I think on the hostages point, if you build a system of record, right? Like it's just so hard to switch. That that has not changed. But now I can go compete. I could build a software product in like 2 weeks that would have taken me two years. So that's going to massively increase the pressure on the application layer. So the best thing that you can do if you're an application layer company is hopefully you know have something that you know I hate to say it but it's like you want to have hostages. You want to have all of the data in your company. uh you you want to have all of the data of your customer in your in your product and then just make sure that you know I mean this is I think the thing that we talked about on last time I was on your show it's like this is the the the you know the battle of every startup versus incumbent is whether the startup gets the distribution before the incumbent gets the innovation right so what do you do you go boring you build the most boring thing possible nobody really cares about it nobody's that interested I mean this why I love Vlad you know Ask Leo is like who cares about procurement ah it seems kind of stupid it's not attracting 9,000 competitors But hopefully you get all of the data in there and then you can build these interesting things on top. Um, and you're not going to attract that much competition. Um, and even once you do, it's just it's kind of hard to switch. So, I don't know if that answers your question. It it totally answers my question but it leads to several more questions which is the theme of this discussion which is the speed with which it takes to compete with the incumbent has reduced and you are able to take customers or market share quicker than ever before with the extension of private markets. Do we not have a liquidity problem then when we look at I don't want to pick on anyone but but [ __ ] it I will say like a company like sneak in the cyber security market which has been going it's now getting eaten away by new incumbents before it's had the chance to return shareholder money liquidate and so do we not have a fundamental challenge here where companies that have not gone public yet or not provided returns to investors are already getting eaten away because that compression time is is shorter. Yeah, I I I think this is a big challenge. I mean, if you look at all of the unicorns and how many conform to rule of 40, it's pretty small. Um, many of them are shrinking. So, probably of the unicorn class, I would bet that maybe 5% will ever be able to go public, which is kind of shocking, right? But uh and then because so much money has gotten into venture capital, you have this problem of I mean I I I will say on the record I hate massive secondaries because it kind of turns you from the catam monocristo like the you know whatever the opposite of that would be like the uh I'm now going to go vacation in the uh you know kazour or something like you don't that's going to now say I I am now at a fundamental disconnect from my employees and my investors because I'm rich and they aren't like that That's not a good setup. You kind of want everybody be to be in the same boat. Um, and the the reason why I mentioned that is like you have some companies where it's like, you know, founders taking a $50 million secondary. It's like that's that that's that's fine if they just turn down a $10 billion acquisition from Google and they're the count of Mona and they go for it like, okay, that that that can make sense to me. And if you offer that to all employees and all investors and everything else, I don't love the idea of it's like people are looking at this as spreadsheets. Um, and I I won't mention names, but like there was a there was a fund in 2021 that did like a massive secondary into one of my companies. And uh I I was really against it, which made me super popular with the founder, you can imagine. But uh they were like, \"Oh, well, we own 4% of the company. We want to own 8% of the company because 8% is more than 4%.\" I'm like, \"Dude, I totally agree with you. 8% is more than 4%. But you have now introduced moral hazard into the equation because if you give somebody generational wealth, um you can hope that they're going to kind of maybe like the upside would be like they're going to swing for the fences and go for it, right? Um because otherwise I would be happy selling for a billion dollars. Now it's like [ __ ] it, I'm going to go for hundred billion. Okay, that that's great. Now we're all aligned. But the other option is now they don't care about getting liquidity for investors. They don't care about getting liquidity for employees. They're quite comfortable. like you don't want to have that setup. >> I I don't I I don't think that's actually the problem. I mean this with the greatest of respect is I think we assume the next strategic steps will be the same with that money versus without that money. And I think what we've both seen is the fuag growaring of startups and then they do 10 things not two things. None of them work. The team is disincentivized. They break up. Culture sucks. >> Moral hazard. That's that's the that's the economic framing, right? It's moral hazard on both primary and secondary to your point. Like it like necessity is the mother of invention. So if you have $und00 billion in the bank when you really should only have $10 million in the bank, you're like, \"Ah, I'll do 50 things. I'll have, you know, multiple layers of people that I don't need.\" And it's interesting. Um, I I find that a lot of people when when I when I think about like the the difference between conservatives and liberals or people that believe in big government, small government, a lot of it comes down to the disconnect between more input is better output. Like a lot of people just believe this. It's like, okay, you know, the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service, like, oh, you know, there's a lot of tax fraud. We need to hire more people, and if we if we have more people, we're going to do a better job of catching tax fraud. are like, \"Oh, the military. We should have more people in the military uh because that way we're going to do a better job.\" Whereas actually, as you know, it's like sometimes there's addition by subtraction. Like, if I have a smaller team, there's less communication necessary. You're going to come up with more creative ways of actually solving the problem. You're going to solve it with technology. Whereas, if you have if if you just say, \"I'm going to solve it on the input layer. I'm going to address I'm going to like address my constituents by saying, I'm going to just allocate more money to this thing.\" you're going to get a worse outcome versus I allocate less money with great people. This is the key. You can't just say like I'm I'm going to allocate less money and give you the worst people on on earth and then No, but it's like, you know, take take tax fraud. I would rather have two people at the IRS than 80,000 people, but have those two people be the like, you know, Nome Shazir and some other like super genius. Um because if Jeff Dean and Nome Shazer are running the IRS like oh my god like that would be so much more efficient but the input cost would be like 1/100th as much and there's always that disconnect. I actually am in trouble with my team cuz I just tweeted today series A is the worst place to be investing. Company progression is minimal price is four to 5x the seed price and we're paying 150 to 200x AR with little signs of product market fit. Do you agree with me? is the worst place to be investing. >> Well, I think the problem is that there's the nomenclature which kind of varies company to company. So like when I started trial pay, we raised our series A was 3.1 million on 9.5 million pre um and that was expensive. I remember like arguing with the partner at battery. It's like this is the most expensive deal we've done. This was 2006 at at Site Advisor. I think we raised 2.7 on 2.7 pre. So even lower. So that you know he hence he was right. So now you have a preede a seed a seed extension a seed extension to like what is a series A right there's not like this like normally a series A would be like the first institutional round of money. Now there's so much variance because like oh there's the series A where it's like five superstars out of open AI and they need tons of money for compute. No moral hazard on that. You're not going to go spend money on people. You're going to spend money on GPUs. That's one form of series A. another form of series A is like I just did a series A where the company had like $10 million of ARR when I invested in it. So it's just all over the place. So I think it's just hard to kind of cast a generality. Um there are certainly ones where like I used to call this the series B trap but again I think the nomenclature has shifted. But I would have agreed with your team if you called it the series B because at that time there was a seed there was a series A and the only difference between series A and series B is that you increased your burn and built infrastructure and kind of scaffolding. So it's like I have a company, I have customers, I have signs of product market fit. I know now I should hire an HR team and a marketing team and all this other kind of [ __ ] that doesn't actually have any kind of impact on the on the you know metrics of the company. And that was the series B. And then it's like why would I invest in a series B because I get half as much ownership and and nothing has changed visa v the series A. So yes, there there's a class of series A's that look like that. But I would say like of the series A's that I personally did in the last year like most of them have been like holy [ __ ] like revenue is really scaling and these numbers are insane. Um and you know those were those were series A's and I get very excited about those but it just I think your mileage varies because the the nomenclature is all over the place. Do you worry about the quick succession rounds when you look at companies like a roulette or a tactto there's just like a week later there's another term sheet for a series B with with literally no change at all and it's buying the cool option. Do you worry about those rounds? >> Well, I did one of them, right? Like I'm on the board of reallet. I did the series B and it was 60 days after the series A and that that's unfortunate. I would have rather done the series A or rather done the seed of course. But if you find the winner, um it's also very expensive not to do that deal. So >> that's really that's that's so interesting that I'm so pleased cuz I I'm so sorry, dude. I totally forgot that you did the real B. But like you got to pay up for that going to the point you've got to assume that the next strategic steps will be the same and be as focused even though you have just faged the company. Sorry. >> Well, but this is where I think the motivation of the founder is very very important. So going back to like I mean Nick uh who's the CEO of real I mean I think he does have a bit of the count of Christo and him like and it's like he doesn't want to go take this money and go spend it on extravagant things. Um so I I think you have to make sure that there's kind of like founder capital fit. Nobody ever talks about that. It's like okay if I give you a billion dollars what will you do with it? And 99 times out of 100, the answer is going to be bad news. And not even bad news around waste, but just bad news in terms of mindset. Like it's another form of moral hazard where it's like I'm never forced into making hard decisions because I have infinite capital. And you kind of want to force people into making hard decisions. And like I lived this I mean I' I've tweeted about some of these things during my my painful existence at trial pay where you know I think we had to lay off 70% of the company and then we eventually turned it around and sold it to Visa and there were all sorts of tough times therein but um you know you you run into these like very very challenging scenarios and it's like option A is bad, option B is bad. You have two two choices. You're at a fork in the road and uh there's a funny expression by by Yogi Bear, this famous baseball player in in the US. Uh when you come to a fork in the road, take it. It's like what does that mean? He said all these like things that make no sense. But you know what a lot of entrepreneurs don't realize is that the worst option you think you have two options but there's a third option which is making no choice at all. That's the worst option. You're better off like just choosing something. And both of them are bad, right? It's like this option is very bad. This option is very bad. So therefore, I don't want to make any choice at all, but you're better off making a choice and committing to something. And if you have infinite capital, you could just kind of continue this. I'm not going to make any choices. I'm just going to sit here and just like, all right, well, I have more money. You know, my my ARR is more driven from the interest on my my giant hund00 million cash reserve. If you h if you and sorry for for rambling on this, but like this kind of goes to like founder capital fit. There's a certain type of person where it's like I give you a lot of money and I know you're still going to make decisions very very quickly. I know it isn't going to distract you and really it's just benefiting me. I hate to say it selfishly, but it's benefiting me is in that now I'm on the cap table. I own part of this amazing company and it's not going to [ __ ] up the company. Um, but like the the standard is it's like the moral hazard is the number one thing. It's like now it's going to [ __ ] up the company either with too many too much primary or it's like oh I know I won't I won't mess with the primary. I'll just buy a secondary. It's like that also has you know existential risk as I mentioned for a certain class of person. There are other CEOs that like you know one of my one of my CEOs did a very very big secondary in 2021 like he in the company is has hit on some tough times but like he has stuck it out and like he's doing a phenomenal job. >> How do you get comfortable about growing into that price that you have well overpaid for? So again we're super candid and this is where I love where I'm at in my stage of life now versus where I was like 8 years ago because it wasn't kind of the same. I lost to Seamer on your team for ask Leo. She's amazing. You guys are amazing. Hugely welld deserved. Um, you guys did not pay more than me. I hate this [ __ ] VC thing where it's like, \"Oh, they overpaid.\" No, it was like the same. You just beat me fair and square. Well done. I reflect on that and I'm like, \"You idiot. You should have paid 300 and doubled them.\" Because when I map out 18 months time, I looked at their revenue projections and in 18 months time when they need to go raise, their revenues would have been so much that I could still see a 3x on that 300. Idiot. That's how I get comfortable with paying up for something. How do you get comfortable preemptively paying up so much? >> I mean, I think it's the same it's the same math, but it's it's dangerous on both sides, right? It's like um I always have this speech that works, you know, maybe one time out of a hundred that I give it, which is kind of like the Spider-Man speech of like with great capital comes great responsibility. And if you raise it too high of a price, you're [ __ ] because I lived this. Let me tell you my story. I raised it this price for my series C. Then I had like Google that wanted to buy me, but it was like at the same price, so therefore it tanked the thing. And then my next round, everybody asked me what was the price of my last round, and nobody wants to invest. Like I I go tell this story. Um, I can introduce the founder to 10 other founders that that have lived the exact same thing. It's like, I wish I hadn't raised my round at such a high price. But who starts a company, right? Like, let's just think about this for a second. The people that start a company are irrationally exuberant. Like, if they thought that the company was going to fail, if they thought they had a 0% chance of raising a series B, they wouldn't start the [ __ ] company, right? So, that's why the speech doesn't work. Um because I always tell people like hey you know the reason why you shouldn't raise your series A like there there was a deal that I guess we should have done candidly because like this company just raised at like a billion dollar plus valuation but we turned it down. Company had like less than a million dollars in revenue and they wanted like a $200 million you know whatever post money series. It was just so crazy. I was like look you guys haven't started the company before. I have. Um not to like pull the the old bald guy card but like you know uh more old than bald. The old part is relevant. The bald part isn't. But like your series B, like even if you have $20 million in revenue, you're [ __ ] Like you have to be able to walk into a room, the number one question you're going to get is what was your last round price? And people should be wanting to compete to pay three times that price. Like they have like, oh my god, what will it take to do this deal? And if you say like, hey, my la my series A was raised at a billion and I have a million dollars in revenue. You have ended the conversation. Nobody want the psychology of that round is all wrong. So I give this speech and it just doesn't work. Unfortunately, but but I think I think the smart entrepreneurs, they kind of have this risk balancing thing. It's like they're irrationally exuberant. That's why they quit their job and started the company. But they realize, oh wow, there actually is a good point around like my whole team now says we have $100 million in the bank. They're going to be wasteful. That culture is something that I don't want. Yeah, I guess I would want the option of maybe selling the company for a billion dollars and having, you know, Salesforce come in and say, \"What would it take to buy the company? What was your last round price?\" Because I will tell you 100% of the time in every M&A conversation, in every fundraising conversation, the number one question, the first question is, \"What was your last round price?\" And if it's like insane, they're like, \"Ooh, that's not good. I\" And then then as an entrepreneur, you're like, \"Oh, no, no, but I would take a discount because my company sucks.\" Like, you can't say that. It just it it just destroys the entire conversation. It's just game over. We >> we mentioned kind of the uh the real element in the successive rounds. I hope it's not too forward and you can say, \"Dude, don't want this in there. Um, by all means, I'm not a journalist.\" But like, you do the success of B because you lose the A. When you sit down and we're sitting down as a team, how do we reflect on that? When you reflect on like a RIT review, what was the takeaway from that when you sat down? >> Well, I mean, there are a lot of deals that we we lose because we're not willing to kind of go the distance on price. I mean that that is a common thing where it's like did we really lose it? Like this has happened to us a number of times. It's like all right, we want to do the deal. This is again like consensus and non-conensus. A lot of times the difference is just on price um or ownership, right? Like if we had shown up and said, \"Hey, we'll do 10% of this company for an A-R.\" Like we could win every deal. It's actually I think one of the one of the competing elements that has shown up I'm I'm interested to watch how Standard Capital does. This is kind of the YC offshoot >> where >> Yeah. It's like um I'm going to take 10%. Like that's very very bad for big funds because in order to make the math work for a big fund, you have to have high ownership and you know that your ownership will get depleted or will will get diluted over time as option pool expansions happen even if you take your pro router in every single successive round. So I mean we can win all these deals but a lot of times um you know I I I am much more preoccupied with ownership um at the a because we're buying an out of the money call option. And and the reason why I I kind of tell this story is because uh you know there there's there's something that I've used as a benchmark which is if you're hiring people and 100% of the people say yes to your job offer, what can you infer from that? Number one, you could infer that you're the greatest hiring manager of all time. But number two, you might be overpaying, right? Would you agree with that? Like if you only get 50% or 20%, like how do you know to test this hypothesis? >> And if you win 100% of the deals, like that's a very very good sign. You should try to win 100% of the deals that you want to do. But if you're winning them with very low ownership, you're probably not testing like this kind of efficient frontier of like how far you can go. And you want to have more ownership, right? Like that that's our objective. Like the founder wants less dilution, the investor wants more ownership. like the two are like kind of perfect complements of each other and um but eventually you realize like I don't want to be a [ __ ] idiot. Like this is the answer to your question, right? It's like all right, I wanted 20% uh in an A round for a company that doesn't have that much traction because you know I'm I'm at Andre Horwitz and I've got this big fund and everything else. Um but and then it's like no no they're going to do a 15% round or whatever. It's like oh [ __ ] that. I don't want to do that deal. Um and then it's like holy [ __ ] they've run away with the market. This is the market leader. I'm not going to be stupid, right? I'm not going to just say, this is why actually, by the way, I love talking to investors because investors, like most humans do not have the capability to admit that they were wrong. Like they just want to like say I'm right, I'm say I'm right, I say. If you're an investor, like you're just going to lose money all the time. The most valuable insight that you can have as as an investor is the self-reflection to say, I'm an idiot. Um, and if I'm if I'm a hedge fund guy, it's like I get to sell. It's like, oh, I thought I was a genius, you know, buying Herbal Life, blah blah blah. Like, oh wow, this company's not good. I'm gonna sell everything versus no, I want to prove to the world that I'm right. Well, I'm going to lose all my money. So, it's the same thing here, but for upside, we can't sell. But we can say like this is the winner. I want to be in the B at a lower ownership because like this is the [ __ ] winner. But if I was your partner, I would be pushing you with all my might to take the 10% at the A and have a higher win rate specifically with your profile of fund because I get it in other funds where you don't have the ability to follow on and lead the B, the C, the D. You may even not be able to do the pro rollers in which case I I get that thinking but when you can why are we not having a higher win rate and doing 10%. >> Well I mean this is actually one of the things that we looked at um because I I kind of feel like my job here is kind of quasi portfolio manager. So I I run our apps fund right so we have seven different funds and my job is to make sure that like that fund is as successful as possible. um and you know we're winning the right deals that we and it's like if we just say hey everybody win every single deal just win every deal doesn't matter that's all I'm going to optimize for and we end up with 5% checks in every series A like you know that's not going to work right we can win every deal that way what is the front how far on this curve can you go um and it's again it's the exact inverse conversation that an entrepreneur is having where it's like I want a tier one investor I want you know an amazing specialist or I want whatever I want on you know this person that I want on my board what is the least least amount that I can give up to get an amazing person. And they would love to get 5% a round deals done, but they're like, \"Oh, wait a minute. Like, that's not going to work.\" And like that that's the the tension between the two. So, I I agree with you, but I think, you know, where do you It's like Zeno's paradox. You know what that is, right? It's like you will never get to the destination if you go halfway each time. Like, is it 9%? Well, why not just do it at 9%. Why not do it at 8? Like, where do you draw the line on that? And I would I would do the simple math of where do I think and this is a very dangerous and bad answer to your question because the biggest mistakes in venture have been when you underestimate market size and you don't see what it can be but I'd sit down with you and I'll go okay 10% entry 5% on exit assuming a 50% dilution. Do we think this can reasonably be a $15 billion company? If so that is a number that returns the fund with comfort. I know, but the problem is it's kind of garbage in, garbage out. It's like you can always say that for something because otherwise you're like, \"Oh, wow. I underestimated the size of the black car market, you know, hence I'm not going to do.\" It's hard. I mean, the way that I do it just kind of to be piffy about it is like we either want to buy any percent any%, right, of something that could work that that is absolutely working or high ownership of something that could work. If you really kind of draw a line of like the you have to bifrogate the market. It's like Facebook um if you look at that round I think Greylock put 25 million into Facebook at a um actually I think the round was maybe 25 million at 500. I think that was the B round for Facebook split between Meritech and Greylock. But that was absolutely working right. So it's like are they getting 10% no are they getting 5%? No. but it's like the market winner and things can go wrong but like holy [ __ ] it's absolutely working and like I don't see that many things that look like that but when they when you do you throw away all the rules or it's like this is not working but this person looks like a super genius um they have high agency they can get they can materialize labor capital and customers but it's not working yet right so like I have to have high ownership in order to take to correspond with that level of risk and those are the two types of deals to do the danger is you say every you could say, \"Oh, well, this has a million dollars of AR and they're ahead of the number two player that has 900K of AR, therefore it's absolutely working.\" No, I you have to have a high bar on the absolutely work. Like, this is this is crushing. This is the fastest growing company we've ever seen. It probably comes around once every decade. Throw away the entire rule book and you should be fine owning 5% of that company because it's it's an absolute winner. >> I'm so pleased that you said about the fastest growing company that we've seen. We've never seen growth rates like we have today. And I'm a little bit stuck if I'm honest. And so I'd love your advice. When we look at companies going from 1 to 20 to 30 to 40, there's actually quite a few that do that today. Before that was completely unheard of. How much weight should we place on revenue growth today versus not? And is there a world where these companies that are going from one to three or four, three or four actually used to be good and left behind? So if if you want to know the the three investment thesis that I have for our fund um I I'll mean this is exactly what I told LPs and and we'll answer your question in a second. I think we have we have three we have one which is we invest in system like I call it green field bingo and most of the green like these are existing software companies but selling to new companies as opposed to you know selling to the hostages that will never leave. They tend to be systems of record right like the re or vertical operating system. So like the reason why real it I love that company so much that's never going to grow like zero to 100 in like a month but it is very very sticky revenue like once you're on like Netswuite has hostages now customers they're not going to leave you know if this can if if real can sell into every new company like they're going to do great the revenue growth will be slower but it will be so sticky and they have infinite option value on adding like hey do you want to have a collections AI agent that runs on top of you know overdue invoices blah blah blah and that's like optionality on top of your sticky system of record. So number one is Greenfield kind of systems of record. Number two, and this goes to the fastest growing companies in the world that you're talking about is like software that does the job of labor. Like these are new this is um like I give you an example like we have a company called Eve. They sell into plaintiff attorneys. What is the dominant software product for plaintiff attorneys? It's called Microsoft Office, right? Like there isn't one. There's so many category like what's the dominant software for like manicures? like there is you could pick all these areas where there's no green field being there's no there's just nothing but because the the thing that you're selling is effectually effectively in lie of labor or like and the way that Eve works is if you're a plaintiff attorney and you get paid on contingency you're not charging by the hour um you have a case where you will with 100% certainty win $1,000 right will you take that case the answer is absolutely not because it's not worth your time so you turn down all the small ticket cases because you want the big ticket cases But now you have a software product that can do all the work and help you win all the small ticket cases. Like you're absolutely going to do that. These are the things that scale like crazy, right? Because instead of hiring somebody for $80,000 a year that I cannot hire, I can now hire this software product for $20,000 a year and before I was paying $0 a year for software. Those are all the things that are hyperscaling. But to your point, if they don't eventually back into a system of record, like if it's something that just does does like outbound phone calls with an AI agent, it's a thin wrapper on, you know, OpenAI or plus 11 Labs plus something else, it will attract so much competition. It won't be sticky. So the the conversation that I have with every entrepreneur that has one of these companies is like, how are you going to make this sticky? How how are you going to, you know, pardon my language, get the hostages, right? How how do you hold these customers and make sure that if you know if you are I'll give you an example like I'm an investor in a company called Saliant which is probably the market leader in kind of outbound loan servicing for autos and this is the conversation I had with Ari. like what if Taliant shows up, you know, the the competitor of salient, the the make believe competitor Saliant, like how do you keep your customers? And they say, hey, we're going to do it for 50% cheaper. And I loved his answer, which is I'm this is my wedge, right? I I recognize that this is this is, you know, not super sticky if we're just making outbound phone calls uh and combining these these different layers of the stack because we're not the infrastructure layer, but we are going to back into a software product. Um, and that's I love that answer and it's true. like that's what they've done. So that's that's my answer to your question is you have you have I mean again they might not be able to pull it off like every company that that says they're going to do this they might not be able to pull it off but you have to back in this mega revenue growth that largely is predicated on doing the job that people would do before and that's why you can grow so quickly into sticky software product that is not that dissimilar from software products of yester year. Um, and then if you want to know like the third thing that we're doing, so it's like number one is, you know, green field bingo. Number two is like software that does the job of labor. And number three, um, I wrote a post about this, but I called it the walled garden. And, um, there are, and I'll give you two examples of this. There's a company in Europe called Vlex. And Vlax was started by this entrepreneur um who uh basically bought up every legal record in Spain um and then started you know like like physical legal records at the courthouse put them into like digital form and then started selling them to law firms and I think he he got this to like something like 20 something million dollars of AR after 25 years um but then added AI and it grew like something like 5x I mean something crazy why because open AI let's just say open AI is purely it's a sentient being agi is here. Open AI has done it tomorrow. Five GPT 5.5 is here. If they don't have if you say like, hey, help me draft a response to this like Spanish court case blah like they don't have the data, right? They can't do that. Or open evidence has done this for uh for health data. Like, you know, AGI is here. Open AI has it. Amazing. I tore my Achilles. What do I do? I'd rather have GPT 3.5 plus infinite data of everything around medical science which is walled garden that open evidence has versus like sentient being that has no data whatsoever. So that's also a very very powerful way of building something sticky. So if you if you find a company that has grown like this or grown like this but just cannot be removed either because of the data that they have that is unique to them which is you know honestly my hope with Leo or has um you know kind of sticky system of record like it's just not going anywhere versus other ones like you might take a flyer it's like wow this has grown from zero to 100 they make outbound phone calls and they're like you know 11 labs plus this plus that and it was all built and lovable and it's amazing but like ah that that's that's a harder pill to swallow. >> We're I'm so honest these days, dude. I'm too old and ugly to not be honest. We're in this business called Aloe in Germany. It's like a toast for Europe, but a little bit better. Specialized to the European market. And they've got great numbers. Um like 5x from like 500k to 2.5 million. Dude, raising their series A like, you know, 8 or 10 on 50ish memory sering horrible. And I was just like, \"Oh my god, the triple triple double double is so dead.\" Like, we're in lovable as well. That obviously is a completely different fundraiser journey. >> Is the triple triple double double dead for those? >> No. No. I I I think um I mean it might it might be harder for a certain set of people that are maniacally focused on like growth over everything else. But like what really matters is growth and stickiness. and the triple if you're triple triple double double with like you know terrible retention data like okay that that's going to be very hard but if you actually have you know again system of record or in that case you know it sounds like vertical operating system that should not be hard if if you find the right I mean like I I would do I I I love those things right like I would much rather have a slower growing you know permanent system of record that will never get ripped out than the fastest growing thing on the planet that has 9,000 competitors that are all built and lovable by 17-year-olds It's like I I think there's no comparison. I mean, there there are plenty of people that would be attracted to both would be my answer. I'm surprised that it that was it was as challenging as you as you portray it. >> We got it done, but I was surprised too by by how challenging it was. C, you mentioned about selling companies that I spoke to David George before the show and he said one thing he's never talked about publicly that I think that he's a phenomenal master on is advice on selling companies. Ask him about that. I know it's a bit broad and random, but I do want to touch on it cuz David said I had to. What's your biggest advice on selling companies having seen so many and living it yourself? >> Yeah. So, I'd say a couple things. Um, you know, this is a very highly choreographed dance. So, you can't just say, \"Oh, I should raise.\" Like, so if you're raising money, um, you're like, \"Oh, I should raise money. I have the best metrics ever. I'm going to talk to five firms and they're going to compete to the death over winning my deal.\" Like, that was my experience with my series B at trial pay. So, it's like, oh, it's so like and and kind of corp dev is like I'm either raising money or selling my company. It's the same thing, right? No, it's completely different. Um, if you're selling your company, you have to spend, you know, in many cases years like just getting to know people at the potential acquirer. It's never the CEO unless you're like, you know, what you know, Yan Kum at WhatsApp. Like, let's just say that you have a company, you you do something amazing. Um, somebody at Salesforce should buy it. um you would rather go public, but you're like, you kind of see the writing on the wall like I'm going to hit a wall in a year and a half. What you should start doing then is um I kind of call it a background process. Like if you know what cron is in in Unix terms, right? It's like you should have a little cron job where it's like 5% of your time as CEO should just be like getting to know people at the three or four companies that might buy you. You never go say like please buy my company. That that's DOA. You don't want to spend time with the corpde dev people because most people like, \"Oh, corpor dev buys companies.\" No, they don't. They execute transactions. Like if Salesforce buys your company, you're not working for the head of corp dev, right? Like you're working for like this this SVP who needs who has some hole on their personnel or, you know, need needs like revenue growth in order to get their bonus. There are all sorts of internal mechanics that are going on there. So, it's just this highly choreographed dance of just like making sure that you get to the right people in the company, you know, hopefully doing it years in advance, not just going to them when you need to sell your company because there are two independent variables here. It's like when your company is doing like the best time to sell, by the way, is your company is doing great. Like this is the like the rocket ship is like 100x year-over-year growth and they want to buy, right? But rarely does that intersect. A lot of times it's like, oh shoot, we started going like that. Now we want to sell, but nobody wants to buy this falling knife. So, it's hard to perfectly choreograph this, but like the the main piece of advice, and I wrote a whole Twitter thread on this, I think, but it's like spend time with, you know, three or four companies, uh, hopefully kind of under the not under the guys because honestly, like when I did this at at Trial Pay, I wanted, you know, Visa to be a partner of mine. I wanted PayPal to be a partner of mine. It was not wasted time. It's like, hey, you know, PayPal, you should put, you know, on your receipt page, you should put uh coupons that we do for this post-transactional product that we have and just spend like I was spending so much time because if I got that deal, right, I didn't I didn't give a [ __ ] if they bought us or not. If I got that deal, it's worth so much money to us. It's worth so much money to them. Unfortunately, um or fortunately, depending on your point of view, they were like, \"Oh, wow. This is so valuable for us. We have to buy that company.\" Right? And like that's that's often but it's like that movie. My favorite movie is Inception. How do you incept this idea? And again, uh in that movie, it happens overnight on like a flight whatever from Australia or something. But it it really needs to happen probably like a year and a half, two years in advance. And a lot of entrepreneurs, they make the mistake of I have to go impress the corp dev person wrong. I have to only interact with the CEO. You know, sometimes, right, like you know, we we hosted a dinner for the CEO of Visa and I sat Zack at Plaid right next to Alec Kelly at Visa. Okay, that worked until it didn't, right? because of the uh the Justice Department or something, but like you know that can if it's sufficiently strategic, you know, these $5 billion acquisitions that don't happen very often, but like you know a 500 million to a billion dollar acquisition like that can happen at not the CEO level. Um and you just have to spend the time and invest the the time and resources beyond like and by the way this is this is the same advice that I give people on fundraising, right? It's like this background process. If you're the CEO of a company, your number one job is don't let the company run out of money, right? Which either means you become profitable, which is great, or you raise more money, which is, you know, not as great, but like hopefully leads to to to being profitable and or you sell your company. So, you probably should spend 5 to 10% of your time, you know, meeting investors in a very casual way, right? Um, so that they know you and they know that you're a very strong entrepreneur and they can like just invest on the spot versus like this is how I raised my series D at trial pay. I had spent so much time with the Greylock guys as an example. I pitched them like after I met Reed like 20 times and it's like he knew me. So he he he knew that he trust like you know he's investing in me as opposed to like a random dude that shows up you know oh I should raise money because I'm running out and I'm growing. Let me go pitch five part like they never would have done the deal otherwise. So it's like the background process is key. Before we do a quick fire around, I just have to ask, you mentioned one element being the labor displacement in the kind of one of the three kind of pinnings that you have. I completely agree. My friend Jason Lmin said this year will be the year where we see the demonization of technology leaders and that we see labor displacement materially shown up in labor markets. Do you think that's true? And will we see labor displacement in labor markets materially show this year? >> I'm not sure about that. I think in certain areas for sure. Um I mean in general like I I could even click up a notch which is if you think about SAS right like broadly speaking I think there are kind of three types of SAS companies right now. There are the ones that are almost impervious to everything that's happening with AI and if anything it's a huge tailwind because they're going to start being they have the distribution they're going to start adding features and that's things like workday and Netswuite and these things where it's like they have the hostages um never going anywhere. On the other side, you have things like Zenesk, right? Where it's like, how many licenses per seat do you need of Zenesk? If now every customer support ticket can be answered automatically, you need zero license. Like their revenue could go down 100%. These are very very different. And then you have things in the middle like Adobe where it's like oo maybe I now whenever I want a logo, I just go to chat GBT. I don't go to like the graphics team. So maybe you'll need fewer graphics designers. Maybe you'll need you know Zenesk you'll need fewer customer support people. That probably is true, right? like there going to be certain areas that will get hit harder than others. But what technology has always done is, you know, people shift into other jobs or maybe some people will be a hundred times more efficient. I think you'll have some cases where labor like now that you know, take take the Eve example that I gave you. Um, wow, now I can do a 100 times as many cases or five times as many cases as I did before. I'm gonna hire three more people like or I I can now be in business by myself because the software helps me do X Y and Z. I think a lot of that stuff is going to start happening. >> I dude I I so respect you but when you look at like a dakagon like in the customer sport it's clearing out when you look at like a Harvey another business that you're in. >> I I I don't disagree. I'm saying it's not un like that's why I kind of gave the the example of like the three types of SAS right? It's like you're going to have some totally impervious and I'm talking about SAS not people. If you flip that to people, it's like, all right, the users of Zenesk are probably going to go away. Therefore, that labor market might get decimated. 100% agreed. Um, on the other hand, it's like if I'm United Airlines and now I don't need as many customer support people because now every answer kind of auto answers itself with AI. Well, you know what? I should probably take care of my best travelers better and give them like a personal human that will be really nice to them and remember their birthday and then they're going to buy more first class tickets for me. I might reallocate some of that labor to other things because I'm making more money and I no longer have this cost. I mean Tony Shay uh who you know sadly departed who ran Zapos you know he had this whole thing which I think is actually correct which is I'm going to turn most people think of customer support as a cost center. They should think about it as a revenue center. You should love your customer and make them love you. There's the story that he would tell around like you know there was somebody who had something really bad happen and was on the phone with a customer support person. No, I think her husband died. Something bad that had nothing to do with the shoe order. You know, Zapo sends that guy or that that woman flowers, right? And like does. So like doing things like that, making your customer love you is something that you can now focus on once you take away the cost center element of something like this or if I'm a law firm. Again, I agree with you like you probably don't need people doing this tedious work and the number of people doing the tedious work will fall off a cliff. No, no disagreement, but I would not be surprised to see smart companies start reallocating them. Like I actually gave a I gave a talk to um the exec team at JP Morgan about this, right? They're like, you know what what what part of our business is going to be, you know, least touched by AI? And I said, you know what, wealth management, right? Because what is wealth management? It's Yeah. Yeah. It's like hopefully like getting good returns for the dollars that you have with us, but it's really like that relationship guy or gal. And like the woman that was running wealth, she was like she like stood up in the audience like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" But it's true. It's like if you have a high EQ and you're good at playing golf with people like you're going to start hiring more people like that because that's how you get more customers and you you kind of re sometimes there will be an opportunity. The upskilling is not like hey everybody should learn how to code. The upskilling might be like stop doing tedious work like answering you know like looking at knowledge base and then you know typing that back with lots of typos into like the the the email response in zenesk but actually start going into like you know send customer flowers like do get to know that customer really well go visit them at their like whatever for the highv value customers that you just couldn't do before. >> Alex I could speak to you all day. I know you do actually have to work as well. Uh I want to do a quick fire around with you. I'm just going to give you a couple of quick statements. What have you changed your mind on most in the last 12 months? >> I've probably changed my mind on Well, as I mentioned, you have to be able to change like it's more of companies where we didn't do the we didn't do like the early round and then it's like I'd rather be rich than right. That's that's what we often talk about. It's like all right, I want to be right. So, we've probably done a couple deals where it's like we passed, you know, round N minus one, we end up doing round N. But I don't think I've changed my mind on that much. May maybe I would say like this idea of private equitizing venture capital. I I wrote a piece I was probably the first one to talk about this in 2023 around how what you're going to start doing is um you know you could buy a company and then add AI to it and you know I think General Catalyst is now like a bunch of firms are now doing this and I was I was the first person to talk about this and I I I called it barbarians at the gate with an AI. Um, I'd probably become more bearish on that just because it feels like just a founder market mismatch. Um, so that's probably the thing that I've changed my mind on the most. >> What product does Andre not have today that you would most like Andre to have? You mentioned GC having like the fund there that does that rollup play. They've got the like consumer performance marketing fund. I can't remember what that's called, but what product do you not have that you would most like to have? I mean I I probably think um I don't know if we would ever do this but uh something around credit for a lot of our companies. So you know we have equity products but we don't have debt products. Um and they have very different return profiles obviously but every one of our companies they need you know General Catalyst actually has one of these. They have a credit fund. Um so either for customer acquisition or if you're fintech and doing lending. So that that would be interesting. But in general we just kind of we listen we don't want to be at odds with our entrepreneurs. Like there's a very solid reason why we don't have that which is like oh you didn't pay back the bill I need to go foreclose. Like that's a as a venture capital firm like you can earn a 1000x on on a winner. You you don't really want to like kind of beat up the uh the companies that are struggling and that's kind of what the credit instrument needs to do. But I I think it's a good product. >> What piece of investment advice has most stuck with you? So like Josh Kushner once told me if you're willing to take less don't do the deal. If you're willing to go from 10 to 7% like, \"Yeah, sure. I Yeah, why not? Don't do the deal.\" What would yours be? >> I think it really is find high agency people uh that know the history of the space that can materialize labor capital and customers that are the catabotic cristo and don't second guess anything. Just like give them money, be their best partner and go versus, you know, question the market, question the this. I I think it really is. I've just become 100% convinced this is entirely about people. 100%. And every round, by the way, it could be a D round, it could be an E- round, it could be an A round, it could be a seed round. >> Can you please tell Martin Casado cuz he [ __ ] tweeted and then took the piss out of me cuz there's this, you know, the graph where it's like it starts here and then goes up here and then goes down here and it's like you start here, it's all about founder and then you end here, it's all about founder and here is when you think you're smart and no market and product. And he was like, you're an idiot. But it's not that >> it's it's it's all about founder. I mean you you have to again it converges on reality at some point in time. Like there's going to be a public company. You can't like tell everybody in the order book of the IPO that's undersubscribed like no no no the founder is really good. Like yes of course it has to converge on reality. But I I think it's like it's it is like materialized labor capital customers like that. That's that's kind of it for me with the right motivation which is the count of cristo. >> Penultimate one. What's your biggest miss and how do you reflect on it? Like I miss deal seed round. another one of yours. [ __ ] I reflect on that. >> Uh, so it probably was one of the first rounds of Plaid, which I subsequently corrected myself for by doing the series C of Plaid. So I think we invested at 2.4 billion for the for the series C. And I was debating a $5 million difference with Zach for the series B. Um, I think I want to do it at 130, he wanted 135, and I think Goldman was willing to pay 200, but he was willing to work with me because of, you know, my my fintech. And it's like no no no five mill like that was just so stupid, right? Um and luckily I I I was willing to admit that I was stupid and did the next round. But uh you could see the difference on uh this is why it's so important to to do two things to correct yourself if you're wrong and not be proud about it. But also if you really believe that this can be a huge company and I I was I was burdened by what has been to quote the great Kla Harris of uh you know oh wow Yodily which had predated Plaid that went public and had a terminal valuation of $600 million. So like of course this like 130 versus 135 or whatever the hell we were talking about was very material but it was so stupid. I love that unburdened by what has been memo that Yeah. Final one for you dude. What does venture look like in five years time when we look at the $15 billion that you raised today? I mean it is obscene to even think that would happen five years ago when we go back. What does it look like 5 years out? >> I think it ends up eating even more of the world. So um this is kind of going back to to Mark's essay around software eats the world. That that largely has happened as I mentioned like the five biggest companies on earth. They're technology companies which was un like unthinkable in 2005. Like technology companies were little service providers to big companies like banks and oil companies, right? So I I think this momentum of kind of everything becomes a software company. It kind of goes into this like thesis too that I mentioned around software does the job of labor. You're going to have all of these areas where it's like there's going to be like, you know, toast vertical SAS proved this or kind of v1. It's like, oh, how is toast worth $20 billion? You're going to have a lot of things like this where it's like brand new markets that have grown like crazy. Um, AI is now allowing software and technology to do so many things that it didn't do before. And this is before even things like robotics. Like, if robots actually work, wow, like now you've expanded the market like another 100x. So I I just I'm just so bullish on the ability of technology um to create enduring value. So you know my my my guess and my hope is that it's going to go up into the right. >> Dude, I told you this is like venture. You have most shows which are like fine and then you have the once in a while which are truly special. Thank you for being my truly special show. It really is rare to have one like this. >> All right. And hopefully I'll see you in London soon.",
