title: How to Make ChatGPT Ads Not Suck
description: >-
  OpenAI announced plans to test clearly labeled ads in ChatGPT's free and
  lower-tier plans. Announcements emphasized conversational privacy, mission
  alignment, and long-term-value principles. Public skepticism centered on
  potential answer influence and trust erosion while proposed remedies included
  granular user controls, ad-flagging and quality ratings, pay-for-results
  transactional ads, contextual offers, brand-funded premium features, and
  branded action agents.
