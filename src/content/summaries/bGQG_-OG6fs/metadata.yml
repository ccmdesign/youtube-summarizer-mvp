title: The Future of Marketing - in 2021 and Beyond
description: >-
  It feels like online marketing changes every day.


  New growth hacks emerge, and old tactics fade off in the distance.


  Our daily tactics shift because consumer behaviors shift.


  People get tired of the same-old same-old.


  They start ignoring the same ad they’ve seen multiple times. They start
  ignoring the same old e-book lead magnet that they’ve seen for nearly a
  decade.


  Thankfully, there are actually still a few constants. There are some
  underlying principles that will continue to stick around despite how often the
  tactics change.


  The future of online marketing will be a combination of the most successful
  techniques of the past mixed with the growing need to personalize everything.
