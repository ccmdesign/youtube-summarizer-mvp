  "fullText": "i'm a bit exhausted i didn't get enough sleep crying baby wakes up every two hours so today i wanted to talk to you guys about the future of digital marketing um where's my size all right as you guys can see and the future is not what you think but don't worry not everything has to be grim there is some good news as well and i'm gonna share with you guys a lot of stats and data so we deal with companies of all different types of sizes from large corporations like the you know fortune 100 all the way to small mom and pops and when you're dealing with companies of all sizes and you've been doing this for roughly 16 17 years you start noticing trends and patterns and what eric and i wanted to leave you with is changes that you can implement so that way you're gonna be better prepared for the next algorithm updates next platform updates so that way you can keep thriving and surviving and doing extremely well so my twitter handle ignore the hashtag i'm the co-founder of ad agency called neil patel digital as i mentioned work with all different types of companies from the facebooks of the world to the microsoft's you know yadda yadda tons of quotes testimonials now the point of all that isn't to say i'm great or i'm amazing i don't think i'm the best marketer out there i still think i have a lot to learn and improve upon but it's more so to show that hey when i'm giving data and facts it's based on what i'm seeing and it's not just me making stuff up and i truly see both sides of the table not only am i an entrepreneur and a marketer myself i also work with companies like google or this one's actually facebook companies like facebook who'll hit me up and pay me money to speak at their own conferences to their own customers as well as companies like google who will hit me up to help market google as well in essence i really do see every single side of marketing i see it from the entrepreneur side the business owner side the marketer side the platform side from the googles the facebooks of the world now before we get started and go into the future marketing i want to play a little bit of a game with you guys so number one how many blogs do you think are there on the web let's see how many of you guys listen to marketing school all right take a guess that's right so you may have a different number you may have a different number you're like no no there's a billion 100 wordpress blogs do you know the real number okay so from what we know and all the stats online there's at least a billion blocks how many people are in the world take a guess yeah roughly 7 billion do you think we need that many blogs that's roughly one blog for every seven people just honestly no we don't need another marketing blog so don't try to copy me all right but in general there's just too much content at this point how many enterprise companies do you think are leveraging digital marketing you know like these old-school companies some of them are like big corporations like fortive how many of you guys have heard of fortiv did you know they're worth like 30 billion dollars and they sell like gas pumps and industrial equipment that you guys use on a daily basis but you never know about okay how many old school companies like that do you think are leveraging digital marketing take a guess who said all of them that's right all of them are pretty much leveraging digital marketing those guys have a ton of money literally piles and piles of it they make more in interest on any given day than we make in a whole year working right so they can outspend us and they when they make mistakes it doesn't really hurt them another question startups they raise money what do you think most of money that they're raising is used for these days ads what else what else what else what do you do you do sales don't try to lie to people you're a salesman i know you're on payroll that if that guy tries to talk to you he's a salesman okay so startups these days when i was starting my first company back in the day we would raise venture capital the money was raised for creating a product engineering servers all that kind of stuff now most companies raise the majority of their money for sales and marketing in other words growth they're trying to figure out how to get more revenue and that usually involves sales and marketing you can talk about growth hacking and looping some product changes but in essence that's where they're spending their money how many of you guys or what percent of the voice searches will be in 2020 what do you think what percentage go for it yeah you you really do listen to marketing school a lot 50 it is things are changing how are you gonna monetize when someone's doing a search over alexa device or google home how are you gonna monetize that have you guys ever thought about that fifty percent i want that revenue for that fifty percent don't you guys so there's a lot of things that are changing and i'm gonna even go over even more you're gonna see me turning my head a lot uh back a bit because there's a ton of stats and data i hope you guys don't get overwhelmed and then we'll go into some of the things you guys can do to ensure that you continually succeed so here's google's revenue 2008 was a recession we're worried about a potential recession coming in the future what happened to google's revenue during the recession it went up what do you think is going to happen to their revenue during this recession it's probably going to go up they'll figure out ways to make it go up if the cost per clicks go down you may see more paid listings on page one right generally speaking performance advertising continues to go up if you spend a dollar on paid ads you expect to make more money than what you spent would you guys agree with that statement so during a recession if you still spend a dollar on google and you make two dollars do you think you're gonna slow down because it's a recession no it doesn't matter if it's a recession a bull market a bear market if you can spend a dollar and make two dollars as long as it's profitable including all your other costs you're going to keep spending as much money as you can and that's what you'll see people will start moving their traditional ad dollars more over to performance-based marketing during recessions so let's go over what i've been learning and the future of marketing and where it's going fact number one and we talked a little about this during our podcast marketing is going omnichannel but i have the data to show you why right so i'm gonna actually go over here because it's easier to see the television screen than the projector here's marketing spend by channel no shocker which place gets the majority of the revenue google who has the largest market cap google next one facebook ads makes sense facebook has a huge market cap then you get into seo and content marketing and social media marketing and then other seo may get a lot of the clicks but paid advertising spend a dollar make two dollars you don't have to wait a long time people keep spending conversion rate by channel google adwords facebook ads seo content marketing social media other why does google adwords convert better than seo if you had to take a guess people are like oh this is paid ads we wouldn't trust it as much why do you think paid ads converts better the what uh intent landing page that's right if you sayed has wp you get a ton of visitors millions a month on those pages i get millions of visitors a month can you just put a squeeze page and make them sign up for hosting in my plugins you could but your rankings would go down if you removed the content you just put that it would go down with pay-per-click if you give them money you can put whatever you want as long as you keep paying them right seo you got to have content sure you can get a lot of traffic but that content you know if you look at auto insurance you click on the first paid listing it's usually type in your zip code and that's it doesn't even have a hundred words of text on the page including the title tag you look at the text based version that ranks on page one there's like a thousand words about auto insurance facebook ads intent isn't there you can still convert them cost per clicks are a lot less and if you can still convince them to convert you just gotta get more clicks seo as we already mentioned social media you guys already know that one other will go into other a bit later average number of social shares per post it's been continually declining what do you think is going to happen in the future you think it's going to go back up no if you want to go back up what are you going to have to give facebook money that's the reality of it and i'm not here to say facebook sucks it's a great platforming channel for marketers you can also start getting creative and leverage like uh messenger chat and all this stuff helps as well that larry talked about earlier but in general social shares are declining that's just the stats now here's where people are publishing content it used to just be where it would be on their own blog but now everyone's leveraging medium tumblr facebook youtube linkedin twitter google doesn't penalize for duplicate content you release content once publish it everywhere you release one video take that same video re-upload it to facebook re-upload it to linkedin re-upload it to pinterest actually i don't think pinterest takes videos but everywhere else that takes videos upload it get that traffic what do you have to lose what percent of organic search traffic goes to your blog you see a trend here not only are people continuing to blog but those pages give information they don't necessarily sell products or service and this isn't google smart for doing this there's nothing wrong with what they're doing this is the trend they're trends the way they adapt google is based off of usage of you and i searching so if we all search for something and we want to read the informational articles what do you think they're going to show more of informational based articles and that's what they're doing right what portion of your customers first bound you through your blog it's increasing why because blogs are ranking better that's what people want to see so if you're not blogging whether you like it or not you're not going to end up generating all those extra conversions in google analytics there's this report called assisted conversions are you guys familiar with this report raise your hand if you are assisted conversions will tell you things like are people reading your blog and then eventually converting this is really important because this will help you put a roi to some of these other channels what has led to your biggest traffic gains shockingly translations most people don't know this number two updating content that works better than creating more content again billion plus blogs we don't need more content we need the still content that's outdated uh outdated to be reupdated remember sye talked about hey when i create three pieces of content a week on one of these sites i'm not really releasing three pieces of content one of them is a updated article why because if you don't keep updating you're not going to keep maintaining your rankings it's no longer you create a blog and you just get the traffic it's now you create a blog you promote it you get the traffic if you don't constantly update remarket that content you're going to lose that traction and someone else is going to take your spot so if you look at this translations has the biggest opportunity because the united states is competitive brazil all these other countries like india they're up and coming there is money there and if you translate your content into their local dialects you can do extremely well because there's not that much competition google needs content within those regions you'll dominate fast you'll maintain at least a bit longer in the short run and you can generate revenue as well when people talk to me they're like neil in india why would we go after that market there's barely any money do you think walmart would pay like 15 or 17 or whatever billion dollars for flipkart if there wasn't money in india do you think airbnb would be doing investments there do you think microsoft and amazon and adobe and all these companies would be investing billions of dollars no so you got to get on these regions fast that is a big future if you translate your content you can find a lot of these people from upwork you can do really well so what channel provides the biggest roi for companies can you guys take a guess on this out of all the survey data there was one channel that provided the biggest roi and it was lumped into other if you guys had a guess what this channel was what would you think it is instagram email what else conversion rate optimization it's the least sexiest channel out there from every company we interviewed and surveyed and we surveyed hundreds of these companies and some of these guys are doing like millions and millions and millions of dollars a month in profit if not billions some of them conversion optimization out of all the marketing channels provided the biggest roi but the smallest investment by far if you can boost your conversion rates by double what does that mean to your paid advertising or your seo or your content marketing you can spend more these channels will become more expensive whether you like it or not paid ads will keep going up whether you like it or not you're gonna keep doing it because it makes you more money if you don't optimize for conversions you're gonna get slaughtered by all the competitors and there's a huge trend in digital marketing right now where a ton of companies are finally starting to spend time in a b testing personalization and all this other stuff that very few people talk about and i know this because if i release a blog post on av testing or personalization no one wants to read it if i release another article on how to get more traffic everyone's like yeah show me this it just shows what you guys want to read the tre and the trend is going two different opposite directions so really start getting into conversion optimization what's also cool about going on the channel is that it's also not hard to see what the competition is doing right because all these channels are getting saturated fast and that is a big trend you have no choice but to leverage all of them you used to be able to create a business off of one channel facebook grew just from the referral program dropbox grew from social media tweet this to get more space you no longer can grow a business through one channel it's becoming more and more competitive the people who are early on sure saeed has access to a huge wordpress community he already is integrated has access to all these users do you think someone can just come in right now and compete with him saeed if you were coming into this right now do you think you can do well compared to you being in this for 10 years why not it's much harder and you got in early enough which gave you that head start hence he was able to leverage one channel and explode now even saeed even though he's done really well he's still expanding into other channels and platforms because that's how you continually grow but you can use tools like the sem rushes see i won't get complaints i'm not just promoting my own tools i'm not getting paid by them either you can use se and russian tools like that to see what people are going after from an seo perspective or paid advertising perspective you can use what runs where to see what kind of media ads people are doing you can use built with to see what technologies people are using so that way you know someone's doing a b testing and stuff you can use like ahrefs to see links to your competition see if you can get them to link to you you can use wayback machine to see if hey someone's doing a b testing very few people do this i don't know why use wayback machine go back see all the variations of their pages you can see their transitions typically the one that they're with now is the one that boosts the conversion rates the most that'll give you idea where to start link explorer by moz another tool that gives you a lot of marketing insights so what do you think happens to your cpas when you go omni channel on everything your cost per clicks all of that you guys familiar with expedia yes how old is expedia exactly they're really old you guys have known about it for a long time expedia recently ran a test where they went omni channel by doing television radio pay-per-click etc do you know what happened to their cpas on pay-per-click like their cost per clicks and cpas went down by double digit percentiles omni channel helps improve your numbers on all channels alright fact number two user metrics are the key to beating google you don't have to increase rankings to get more search traffic here's the old site that i have i eventually got rid of it nutrition secrets it was a nutrition site i got my traffic up and to the right and yeah there's writing content and building links and all that kind of stuff but the real way we grew nutrition secrets we did something really manual at that time there was no software that could do this now there is and i'll tell you about the software in a bit i don't have a screenshot but you go into google search console i still like the old version i don't know why you know you click click ctr impressions you see the pages that are getting the traffic and then from there you look at which you click into the page that has a low ctr you look at the keywords the ones that are driving a lot of impressions but low clicks and then you're like all right i need to adjust my page with these keywords so i can get more clicks simple concept you look for keywords that have less than a five percent click rate look for pages that have a less than a four percent uh ctr rate and make sure the keywords that you want to rank for in your title tag and within your content and meta description once you make that change you submit to google and they recrawl it and here are some keywords that help skyrocket ctr that we've tested how to's list number results free you tips great tricks best why blog posts you guys get the gist these have all worked really well from everything we've tested and as you submit it back to google and you fetch and you submit the url click submit to their index and boom you're in you say you're not a robot and you give it 30 days and you see results we used to do all this manually that's how we grew our traffic it's one of the best ways because google is looking for user signals everyone focuses on links but not enough of this if you don't want to do it manually like how i used to do it there's a tool called click flow you can harass someone on the single grain team they can probably tell you about it sorry single grain team but nonetheless you know that's what we do now we just automate it and it works much easier but i kid you not this is where we're seeing the biggest search gains right now for seo we're just optimizing going after user signals it's not sexy no one talks about it works again i know if i write a blog post on this it doesn't get read as much but this is where we're getting the traffic increases and luckily because i have you in front of me you're forced to listen to whatever i want to talk about technically you could walk out quick flow c-l-i-c-k-f-l-o-w it's not called click flow do not sign up for that company that's what it's called i'm kidding so eventually here's the thing that most people don't talk about user metrics are going to go on all platforms did you know on facebook instagram linkedin what is the number one metric that they look at on if a post should go viral if you had to take a guess what do you think it is what is it take a guess time okay that's one shares engagement what's engagement mean comments comments the more comments you get legitimate comments that impacts how viral a post goes more than anything else i kid you not if you had 50 of your friends go to your facebook page and start leaving comments interacting with each other that post goes viral don't believe me all people in this room go comment on my latest facebook post and you guys will see seriously just if you don't believe me go and try it you can write whatever you want and i'll respond to you and if you want to respond back and leave another comment too you'll watch i'll respond back again as well that's how confident i am that it'll work but i know you need to see it to believe it so go and leave a comment on my facebook page make sure it's the latest post so that one gets the most traffic but that's how effective user metrics are i used to put in all my youtube videos and facebook videos leave a comment ask a question my comment number started going up really high my videos went viral and then youtube and a lot of these uh platforms have now built in if people are asking for comments in their videos and i noticed the day it hit because my numbers started going down i'm like man so now i'm trying to think if i can put a visual image saying leave a comment to see if that works but it worked for a while fact number three you gotta focus on branding brands are the future you need to build a brand now this is a quote from eric schmidt the ex-ceo of google brands are the solution not the problem brands are how you sort out the cesspool the best part is eric and i say this code on our podcast so often we never get the quote right we always butcher it but now we have the real one right in front of us so you know what google is doing to help try to solve fake news and figure out which sites to rank higher what do you think they're looking at brand signals that's right what do you think facebook's doing to try to combat fake news what do you think they're trying to promote what type of pages and content versus others brands that's right if you have a bigger brand you're going to do well you don't have to build a coca-cola but if you build a brand within your niche and you're the leading player your content within that space is going to go more wild than the others and the expedia example we all know about expedia expedia owns a lot of properties hotels.com they used to own travago tripadvisor all these other properties they still own a lot that uh gnome one i don't even know what that one's called i think orbits or something like that uh or travelocity or i don't know they just have too many properties so with expedia even though people knew their properties when they started running tv more digital campaigns more pay-per-click all their cost to acquire from all the channels went down because people had their brand top of mind it wasn't that they didn't know who expedia was it was oh expedia i forgot about that company we forget about every single company remember how uber was a talked about company back in the day and now not so much other than uber went public their stock didn't do as well as they would like dropbox such an amazing company this company is revolutionary yada yada yada now oh yeah it's another publicly used company i can just upload my information on my icloud i can upload it on my g drive i can still use dropbox but i got all these other things as well we all have patterns of what's in and out it doesn't matter if you built a big company you still need to be top of mind so you want to keep pushing your brand the key to building a brand whether it's a personal or corporate one is a rule of seven how many times can people see you are you continually doing email marketing to get people back to your site are you doing push notifications are you doing things like messenger boss all these things will help you get people back to your site so much more often you can build a good brand how many of you guys get a hundred thousand visitors a month to your site how many get more than that raise your hand how many get less than that raise your hand i just want to see if you guys are lazy or not or tired or i suck as a speaker okay so majority raise your hand i focus on doing an omni channel approach putting content everywhere i get over a hundred thousand visitors a month from people typing in neil patel i'm not saying i'm good at building a brand i think i'm not that great there's way better people like gary vee tony robbins etc and i'm more of an introvert as eric knows i've known him for a long time i stay inside my house i watch netflix a lot bad bloods is amazing if any of you guys haven't watched that and uh you know i'm waiting for season three though uh so uh and sneaky pete by the way on amazon that was amazing in two weekends i watch all three seasons uh and i work while i am on or watching tv like that's how i work i don't go to office i sit on my bed and my team will tell you they'll facetime me like we'll be on a client call and i'll be in my bed talking to the client over zoom while i work because that's how i get the most done but the way i built a brand is the rule of seven you keep getting people back now i over a year ago eric mentioned this i acquired a company called ubersuggest and that guy was from italy and i paid i think around 120 grand for it he built a better brand than me and he didn't do anything that i did i think he's smarter than i am and what i did is i just leveraged what he did and i put on steroids by just going to the nth degree being like let me just update your tool and give away more for free i now get three times the brand queries over three hundred 000 visitors a month from people looking for uber suggests than i do from people looking for neil patel those brand queries help skyrocket your rankings you got to build a brand every time i grow my brand queries i notice that my rankings for all my terms like online marketing pop up on the top of page one it's not that i try to build more links or any of that it's i focus on brand queries it's that powerful so here's some tips emails are still effective push notification in combination with email marketing is really good combine that with messenger bots then you're really doing well right which was the next one and then you want to use tools like google correlate to help you figure out what people are looking for that's similar to your keywords so for example if i'm in the hotels hospitality industry i want to see what other things people are looking for google correlate shows you all the other relevant keywords with similar patterns make sure you have content on all those keywords that way you're helping people out because if you're helping people out what do you think it does it helps build a brand putting people first is the right thing to do just like when eric and i through this event we were debating we both decided we wanted to do it for free why because we're like let's help people out we didn't do it to try to close revenue we didn't do it to try to generate business or anything we're just like this will be fun let's just help people out people helped us and yeah the positive side is it may help us increase our brand not buy a ton i don't mean to be in a roadway with 200 max people it's not going to skyrocket our brand but it's about just giving and helping and if you truly enjoy that and whatever you're doing it'll help build your brand as well but that's a side effect it's like people saying i want to make money you don't make money by making money you make money by helping people and help them solve their problems put other people first and eventually you will build a bigger brand and nutrition secrets as we started doing all this stuff our branding started going up and we started doing better getting higher rankings more pages and that's how we continually climb but traffic and all this kind of stuff is great but it's not everything semrush showed one of my past startups kissmetrics i think we raised like 17 million bucks for it it didn't turn out well i bought out the domain name from the investors for 500 000 bucks and then redirected the traffic and then they recently did an asset sale now i had good traffic my competitor mixed panel who copied my product at the beginning they even had a techcrunch article showing similar screenshots had roughly one third of the traffic they raised money at 865 million valuation what do you think we were worth i'm the traffic guy i'm getting all this traffic i'm beating them what do you think we were worth anyone want to take a guess you could be honest it won't hurt my feelings you can say something good or bad take a guess your management consultant what do you think more than 15 because we raised 17 but technically not when i bought the domain name um but we're worth roughly one-tenth that technically not even one-tenth that so maybe one-fifteenth one-twentieth that's brutal right think about it i'm a marketer i'm on cloud nine getting all this traffic it shows you traffic isn't everything and i realize at that point the real formula to success especially in the future is traffic plus conversions cubed equals success the more you focus on conversions the better off you guys are going to be i'm hammering that so much because i know in a year you guys won't be able to do a lot of the marketing techniques that you're using right now unless you focus on conversions which gets into fact number four conventional cro techniques won't work well interactive quizzes i use a lot of this stuff on the neil patel site it gives you some conversion lifts i even leveraged two-step checkouts for e-commerce i even do pop-ups that are like do you want more traffic yes or no if you click yes you're gonna get a guide that teaches you how to get more traffic if you click no what do you think you get no if you click no i would be like congratulations on having massive traffic now let's help you double your conversion rate put in your name and email funny enough that actually works really well it's kind of creative so what's wrong with all the tactics i mentioned pop-ups all this stuff they're not bad but what's wrong with them they're annoying that is true they still work but they're annoying i i hate them but they're annoying what else is what's issue you see them everywhere and because you see them everywhere do you think they work the same that they did five six years ago no the effects weren't out personalization is a new conversion rate optimization it's all about personalizing the experience so here's an example now i operate my day in which i have a few companies and there's a ceo in place of a lot of these companies they're starting to use tools like intercom and i'm not saying this because intercom's a sponsor this was i actually did the opposite once eric and i someone told us yaniv he's like why are you guys putting your money out of your own pocket for the event why don't you get a sponsor and eric and i were like that's a smart idea we're really stupid for not thinking of this that's really what happened am i right eric we were just like we're like how much should we each spend 20 30 grand each and then he's like you guys are dumb a company will give you the money we're like oh my god you're brilliant where'd you come up with this he's like every conference does this we're like oh yeah so when we when we look at a lot and you can use any tool you guys want out there it doesn't make a difference to me being honest but when you start personalizing that experience to start chatting you'll notice that you can adapt what you do to each person whether you do that through facebook messenger bots whether you do it to drift intercom the big point i'm trying to make is you need to start creating personalized experience for every single person that's where we're seeing the conversion lifts because then you're getting data on everyone and you're seeing the lead type the quality what they even thought about your conversation if they rated that it's amazing conversation do you think you have a higher chance of converting that person of course if they start asking you through chat about pricing and how they sign up you can tailor your uh your messaging and your content totally different than if they asked you how do i use your product that would be more support or why should i buy you or use you over the competition you need to personalize everything chat is now responsible for 28 of our sales you need from nextiva i believe his chat is responsible for roughly a third of his sales one-third we're even seeing it help with e-commerce you guys need to start using it but don't just rely on things like intercom for a chat you need to go above and beyond that you need to start leveraging product tours and i know this whole you know stigma out there like oh product tools really for sas companies and when people log in i'm going to show you something different here's google what do you think is on the right right there that's a functionality of a product tour them trying to get you into more features more reports more sections of google's products and platforms here's something within their gmail app did you know you can also schedule a send notification that actually happened on my phone my designer i'm like who designed this makes us look pretty he gave me one with the ghetto iphone because he's like you're too cheap to get a real iphone i still have an old school iphone i'm looking in my pocket i still have like a really old iphone so he's like you get the design of an old iphone until you upgrade so i was like okay i don't want to spend the money but even then they're doing product related stuff so check this out this is animated on a checkout page check this you see that moving part on the animation that's examples of how you can use product tours on things like checkout pages and lead forms isn't that slick no the conversion rates go through the roof when we started doing all this and started testing this conversions lifted by 13 so you start combining all these little things you're not going to get one thing that grows your sales by 50 but you start combining all these little things what do you think this allows you to do spend more on paid ads as google increases their prices as facebook increases their prices and they're not increasing it for the sake of it they're increasing because more people are jumping on and you're competing with more people it's supply and demand fact number five to win you'll have to think like a winner what do these people have in common michael jordan mark zuckerberg michael phelps other than their names start with the m yes they all want to win they actually all have one two of them are billionaires michael phelps is amazing talented swimmer he's aussie like ryan is he ozzy or he's american no he's american my bad he's not ozzy right they all have coaches and mentors who helped him get to where they are today you need to invest in mentorship it doesn't have to be paid this is a free event you can you know you can go to other free events you can listen to a podcast eric has this podcast called growth everywhere where he's interviewing people and they're revealing their revenue numbers if that's one of your competitors you listen to it you can figure out how they grew and you can copy some of it look if you're gonna climb mount everest would you just fly over to nepal climb to the top and get there no you would probably die you would get a sherpa to help you out and do your training the same goes with anything you do in marketing and business go read articles find people who can help you out again you don't have to pay for it there's a lot of free stuff online the reality is marketing never stops what works today may not work in the future so the best approach is to continually test and keep learning you're going to be overwhelmed by the information and you know what just go after the low hanging fruit try one thing if you're going to take one thing away from this presentation try some cro stuff if you don't you're going to get beat by all your competitors in the few years probably in 12 months because that is where the market is going it's so competitive everyone's raising money to pile on marketing scales they're using reid hoffman's concept of blitz scaling spend money at all costs to generate revenue even if you're not profitable it's screwing up the margins for most of companies you need to focus on conversions there's three types of people those who make things happen those who watch things happen and those are wondering what just happened be the person who makes things happen thank you guys for attending later we'll get into q a during our marketing school live",
