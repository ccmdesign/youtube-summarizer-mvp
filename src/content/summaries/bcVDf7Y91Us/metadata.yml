title: AI's Water Bill is INSANE
description: Sam Altman claims a single GPT request uses just 1/15 of a teaspoon
  of water, but that deceptive figure ignores the massive water consumption from
  training massive models, the energy-hungry reasoning processes that power
  every response, and the sheer scale of billions of queries running 24/7 in
  data centres worldwide. When you account for the real costs - cooling systems,
  server maintenance, and the infrastructure supporting AI at scale - the actual
  water footprint becomes mind-boggling.
