If you're on Mac [music] OS or Linux, just open a terminal. Enter this command, sshen. You'll get these prompts. Press enter [music] three times and bam, keys created. But if you want additional protection for your private [music] key, you have a second option. At the first prompt, you should still press enter to choose the default location for the private key so other programs can automatically [music] find it and use it. However, at these prompts, you can pick a password. Type the same on both prompts. Note that nothing [music] will be displayed on screen. That's normal. This will encrypt your private key file, which adds some protection. If someone steals your [music] file, they cannot use it without knowing the correct password. And that's it. Job done. But what's next? The command generated two keys, one private key and one [music] public key. Here you can see where they're saved. Identification shows you the full path to your private key file, and public key [music] shows you the full path to the public key file. As the name suggests, it's the public key that you can safely share with co-workers, companies, [music] servers, and so on. The file that ends with the pub extension. Sharing the public key is like giving people a lock they can install on something that only your private key can unlock. Which means that [music] you never share the private key with anyone. You share the lock, not the key. Remember where the public key was stored. Whenever you need it, open that file in any simple text [music] editor. Select all this text and copy it. Then paste it wherever it's required. So the next time you",
