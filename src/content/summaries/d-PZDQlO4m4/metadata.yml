title: Automate all your NotebookLM Research and content creation with this
  Ultimate MCP
description: >-
  Unlock the full power of Google NotebookLM directly from your IDE or AI tools
  with this new MCP. This custom MCP server lets you automate research, generate
  podcasts and infographics, and manage notes using AI agents like Claude Code,
  Codex, or Gemini CLI.


  In this video, I demonstrate my latest open-source project: a custom-built
  Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for NotebookLM. I'll walk you through the
  full installation process, the unique authentication method, and real-time
  demos of creating notebooks, syncing Google Drive sources, and generating AI
  audio overviews purely through command-line prompts. 


  Whether you're a developer or a "vibe coder," this tool bridges the gap
  between your code editor and your knowledge base, allowing for powerful
  automated workflows.


  Key Takeaways

  - How to install, configure, and authenticate the unofficial NotebookLM MCP
  server.

  - How to programmatically create notebooks, import sources, and generate
  complex study guides.

  - Live demos of using Claude Code + Wisper Flow to automate all NotebookLM
  activities without using the UI
