  Build a semi-autonomous video editor using **Claude Code** to orchestrate local and cloud tools. 
  - **Key Tech Stack**: Uses **ffmpeg** for video processing, **Whisper** for local transcription, and **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for natural language logic.
  - **Outcome**: A functional Next.js app capable of manual timeline editing and "semantic editing" via text prompts like "keep only clips about money."

## Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates how **Claude Code** can transition from simple scripts to building complex, full-stack multimedia applications by integrating various APIs and local CLI tools.

*   **Semantic Video Editing**: By combining transcription with LLM reasoning, users can edit video based on content and meaning rather than manually searching for timestamps.

*   **Hybrid AI Workflow**: The project leverages local models (**Whisper**) for data processing and cloud APIs (**Gemini 1.5 Flash**) for high-level decision-making and function calling.

*   **Plan Mode Efficiency**: Using Claude Code’s **Plan Mode** allows for pre-computation of architecture, enabling the AI to ask clarifying questions about UI components and model sizes before execution.

*   **Rapid Iteration**: The developer used Claude to quickly fix UI bugs, such as timeline snapping and clip merging, by providing screenshots and descriptive feedback.

## Summary

The video provides a comprehensive walkthrough of building a semi-autonomous AI video editor from scratch using **Claude Code**. The host begins by setting up a development environment in **Cursor**, integrating documentation for the **Gemini 1.5 Flash API**, and ensuring local dependencies like **ffmpeg** and **OpenAI's Whisper** are available. The primary goal is to create a tool that can not only handle manual cuts but also process natural language instructions to automatically edit video segments.

### Application Architecture and Planning
The project uses a modern web stack featuring **Next.js**, **Java

Script**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The host utilizes Claude Code’s **Plan Mode** to outline the application’s requirements. During this phase, Claude asks critical follow-up questions regarding the specific **Whisper** model size (selecting 'small' for performance) and UI features like drag-and-drop support and waveform visualization. This collaborative planning ensures the generated code aligns with the user's technical constraints and functional needs.

### Development and UI Iteration
Claude Code proceeds to generate the core components, including a video uploader, a timeline interface, and the **ffmpeg** integration for back-end processing. The host demonstrates an iterative debugging process: when initial clip deletion failed to bridge gaps in the timeline, a simple prompt and screenshot allowed Claude to implement **automatic timeline snapping**. This feature ensures that when a clip is deleted, the remaining segments move left to maintain a continuous video flow.

### Semantic AI Editing Features
The highlight of the project is the **AI Edit** functionality. The workflow follows a specific pipeline:

- **Audio Extraction**: The system uses **ffmpeg** to pull audio from the uploaded video.

- **Transcription**: A local **Whisper** model converts the audio into text with precise timestamps.

- **LLM Reasoning**: The user provides a natural language prompt (e.g., "Keep only the parts where Claude goes crazy"). **Gemini 1.5 Flash** analyzes the transcript against the prompt and returns specific start/end times.

- **Automated Clipping**: The app then exports a new video file containing only the requested segments.

The host successfully tests this with complex queries, proving the system can identify specific themes like "identity crises" or "making money" within a long video file without manual time-seeking.

## Context

This video is highly relevant to developers and content creators interested in the intersection of **AI Agents** and **multimedia production**. As LLMs become more capable of tool use, the shift from manual video editing to 'semantic editing'—where software understands the video content—is accelerating. This demonstration highlights the power of **Claude Code** as a coding assistant that manages complex project lifecycles, from architectural planning to debugging and integration. It serves as a blueprint for how small-scale developers can leverage powerful models like **Gemini 1.5 Flash** and **Whisper** to build sophisticated tools that were previously the domain of large software engineering teams.
