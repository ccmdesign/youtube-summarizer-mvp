  What's really happening with AI and the job market in 2026? The common story is that the Toby Lutke memo was either visionary leadership or a smokescreen for layoffs — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on how one CEO memo triggered a talent market restructuring:

   • Why Shopify's Red Queen culture made the AI mandate work
   • How the copycat wave at Duolingo and Box mostly failed
   • What a U-shaped talent market actually looks like
   • Why AI fluency is moving from differentiator to baseline expectation

  The memo wasn't about productivity — it was about selection pressure. By making AI usage a performance metric, Lutke reshaped who would want to work at Shopify and who would thrive there. Eight months later, the pattern is propagating industry-wide.

  For professionals navigating this shift, the training gap is becoming a strategic liability — but the tools to skill up have never been more accessible.
