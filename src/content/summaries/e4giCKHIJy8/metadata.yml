title: Google Antigravity is Looking Pretty Good Now
description: >-
  Antigravity from Google is changing how developers code with AI. This Google
  Antigravity tutorial covers the new agent harness with Gemini 3 Pro, showing
  you workflows that rival the best tools. Google Antigravity vs Cursor? We
  break it down.

  Google Antigravity has quickly become a favorite among developers since its
  release, and for good reason. In this Antigravity Google deep dive, we take
  the agent harness principles that Cursor recently published and apply them to
  Google's newest AI coding tool.

  This Google Antigravity tutorial walks you through every component that makes
  the harness work: instructions, tools, and user interaction patterns. We cover
  Plan Mode, which lets you comment directly on generated plans for easy
  revisions. Context management is another major focus, showing you why you
  should let agents grep for what they need instead of manually tagging files.

  The Antigravity Google tutorial continues with rules and skills that extend
  agent capabilities using the open standard from Anthropic. You'll see how to
  set up project-specific guidelines and load specialized skills dynamically to
  keep context clean.

  For those wondering how to use Google Antigravity effectively, we demonstrate
  test-driven development workflows, image-based prompting for UI
  implementation, and parallel agent execution across branches. The debug mode
  skill section shows an evidence-based approach to squashing bugs
  systematically.

  Google Antigravity vs Cursor comes down to specific features like inline plan
  commenting and workspace sharing between agents. Google Antigravity vs Claude
  Code is also worth considering since Claude Code with Opus remains the most
  capable but costs more. This Google Antigravity review covers practical
  workflows that work regardless of which tool you choose.

  Whether you're coming from Cursor, Claude Code, or just starting with AI
  coding, these harness principles will transform your development process.
