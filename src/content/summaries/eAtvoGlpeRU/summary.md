  title: "You're Probably Running Ralph Wiggum Wrong (Do This Instead)"
  description: "There's a lot of hype about Ralph Wiggum in the AI coding community, and most people are getting it wrong. In this video, I break down how to run long-running autonomous agents safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively—covering both the official Claude Code plugin and the original bash loop method.


    I share my complete setup: sandboxing, the plan.md, max iterations, and feedback loops so the agent can verify its own work.\ 


    The bash loop gives you fresh context windows per iteration—the plugin doesn't, and that matters more than you'd think.

## Key Takeaways

Jered

Blu outlines a framework for running "Ralph Wiggum"—a continuous autonomous loop for AI agents—to ensure they are safe, cost-effective, and efficient.

* **Bash Loop over Plugin**: The original Bash loop implementation is preferred because it starts a **fresh context window** for every iteration, avoiding the "context bloat" that leads to hallucinations in the official plugin.

* **The Safety Sandbox**: Always run autonomous agents in a **sandbox** to prevent unintended system changes while bypassing repetitive permission prompts during overnight tasks.

* **The Plan/Activity Framework**: Based on Anthropic's research, using a `plan.md` (for task tracking) and `activity.md` (for logging) provides the agent with necessary structure and history.

* **Iterative Validation**: Give the agent a feedback loop, such as **Playwright MCP** or **Claude for Chrome**, so it can visually verify its work before proceeding.

## Summary

Ralph Wiggum is a popular strategy in the AI coding community to keep agents like **Claude Code** running until a task is truly finished, solving the common issue of agents stopping too early. However, the video argues that many users run these loops inefficiently. There are two primary ways to run Ralph: the official **Claude Code plugin** and the original **Bash loop** (pioneered by Jeffrey Huntley). Jered

Blu strongly recommends the Bash loop method for long-running tasks because the official plugin triggers on a "stop hook" within the same session. This leads to **context window bloat**, which can cause the AI to lose track or hallucinate. By using a Bash loop, each iteration begins with a clean context window.

### The Four Pillars of Success
To run Ralph Wiggum effectively, four specific criteria must be met: safety, planning, cost-effectiveness, and validation. **Safety** is achieved by running the agent in a **sandbox**. This isolates the AI's environment, preventing it from making destructive changes to the host system while allowing the user to "auto-allow" bash commands. This is essential for true autonomy, as it prevents the agent from being blocked by permission prompts while the developer is away from the keyboard.

### Planning and Structure
Efficiency requires a pre-defined roadmap. Before starting the loop, users should create a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** and break it down into a `plan.md` and an `activity.md` file. This approach is based on Anthropic’s "Effective Harnesses for Long-Running Agents" paper. The `plan.md` file acts as a checklist with failing vs. passing statuses, while `activity.md` logs every change and command run. This structure ensures the agent has clear success criteria and doesn't waste tokens on ambiguous decision-making.

### Execution and Validation
For **cost-effectiveness**, never run an open-ended loop. Instead, set a `max_iterations` limit (typically 10-20) and define a **completion promise** (e.g., stopping when the agent outputs the word "complete"). Finally, to close the feedback loop, the agent needs a way to verify its work. In the Claude Code plugin, this is done via **Claude for Chrome**, allowing the AI to see the UI. In the headless Bash loop method, Jered

Blu recommends using the **Playwright MCP** to take screenshots and validate that code changes actually work as intended before the loop continues.

## Context

This video addresses a shift in the AI engineering community from simple chat-based interaction to **autonomous agentic workflows**. As tools like **Claude Code** become more powerful, developers are looking for ways to handle complex, multi-step tasks without manual intervention. Ralph Wiggum represents the "agentic loop" trend. Understanding how to manage these loops—specifically avoiding **context bloat** and ensuring **system safety**—is critical for developers who want to integrate AI agents into professional production pipelines without incurring massive costs or security risks. This connects to broader trends in **Spectrum Development** and the move toward more reliable, long-running AI operations.
