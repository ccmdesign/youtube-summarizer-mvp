title: Claude Just Introduced a New Way To Fix Your UI
description: >-
  In this video, Claude finally shows how to fix basic AI-designed UIs using
  powerful Claude Skills inside Claude Code. I also test Claude AI in real
  projects, using Claude Code VSCode setups to see how creative it can actually
  get.

  In this video, we take a deep dive into how Claude approaches front-end design
  and why so many AI-generated UIs still look basic. Using Claude Skills, Claude
  Code, and the new design-focused features from Claude AI, I break down how you
  can push your AI to create genuinely aesthetic layouts instead of the usual
  safe, generic outputs.


  We explore real examples, test Skills inside actual projects, and compare how
  these instructions reshape everything—from typography to themes, gradients,
  and component structure. If you're into AI coding, vibe coding, or building
  full projects with an AI partner, this video shows how far you can push design
  quality with the right system prompts.


  You'll also see how Claude behaves inside Claude Code VSCode, what works, what
  breaks, and how the MCP ecosystem ties into all of this. I also compare Claude
  vs ChatGPT and explain how tools like Claude Code MCP and Claude MCP help load
  specialized expertise exactly when the model needs it.


  Whether you’re experimenting with AI tools, exploring new artificial
  intelligence workflows, or just want to learn how to use Claude for front-end
  design, this breakdown shows how the new Claude 4 models actually perform when
  put to the test.
