  What’s really happening inside AI-powered deal hunting on Black Friday?
  The common story is that any large language model can find bargains — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on which AIs actually surface the best deals:
  • Why intent clarity determines whether LLMs deliver real value
  • How browsers and models differ in economic search behavior
  • What ChatGPT 5.1 got right that Claude and Gemini missed
  • Where prompt engineering shifts the gap between agents and models

  When the stakes are finding real savings, operators need to know which AI tools are actually reliable.
