title: Microsoft's Plan to Make People Less Angry About AI and Electricity
description: >-
  Datacenter policy and rising electricity costs are driving 2026 campaign
  fights over affordability and prompting presidential pressure on Big Tech to
  cover local utility impacts. Microsoft unveiled a five-part community-first
  plan to pay local utility equivalents, cut water use, create jobs, increase
  tax revenue, and fund AI training and nonprofits. Chip export controls,
  possible bans on NVIDIA H200 shipments, major chip startup fundraising, and
  OpenAI's acquisition of Torch underscore geopolitical and market tensions
  around AI and healthcare data.
