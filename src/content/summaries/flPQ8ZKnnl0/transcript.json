  "fullText": "Hey folks and welcome back to Smashing Meets Easy Accessibility. So far we've had a couple of excellent talks about different tools and processes and workflows that we can incorporate to make accessibility a little easier in our uh you know in our day-to-day work which we know you know is a bit of a you know misnomer. I mean, easy is is such a a a relative term here, but so far, you know, we're getting such really great practical advice to help us think through, you know, how we can simplify these these processes that are often times very complex and technical and difficult to understand how to do in a team environment. Um, you know, have you ever like had to like uh or have you ever been asked to like incorporate delight into your your work, you know, like like a delightful user experience? Have you ever heard of delightful? you know, when uh when describing uh UX. Well, I I know I I hear that a lot and that's oftentimes something that like I hear in in feedback when it comes to work, like you know, you know, how can we get, you know, create, you know, a delightful experience? Well, that's what Emily Anderson is going to talk with us about. She is the founder of Ampersand, which is a a boutique design studio, and she has spent the, you know, the majority of her career asking what the heck can go wrong with something. And I really like this because you know what Emily's going to talk about is how we go beyond the idea of creating these delightful happy experiences and how we can be more human in the sense that humans come with a wide array or you know diverse set of of emotions and happiness just happens to be one of them. So how can we think outside of that box and incorporate more emotion into the work that we do. So Emily welcome to the stage. >> Hi thank you. What an intro. Uh, very great, very great introduction. Yeah, nice to meet you and great to be here. >> Awesome. >> Well, I Oh, yeah. I'm really excited to to hear about this because like I said, I hear that that that delightful um, you know, descriptor a lot and we know that, you know, not everyone is feeling delightful all the time. So, how can we incorporate or like account for those types of experiences, too? So, I'm looking forward to it. Good luck. >> Great. Thank you so much. Uh, so I will just move things around so I can get to the right screen. Um, perfect. So, hi everyone. Um, great to be here and yeah, as I said, there's been two brilliant talks so far and thank you so much for sticking around for mine. So, it's called Beyond the Happy Path, and it's going to be centered a little bit more on things like inclusive design and how can we create meaningful experiences for our users, the people using them directly or indirectly. Um, so a little bit less uh centered on accessibility, but more just generally around um inclusive design. So, I want to start by asking you a question. How would you feel if you received any of these notifications? Great news. You're spending less. Hungry? Grab your tasty deal today? You're winning. You lost £5. Keep going. And did you forget to log your period? Now, on the surface, you might be thinking, I would feel fine. If anything, these notifications are actually quite positive and encouraging. Well, actually, unless we understand the reality and the context of why people are using our products and services, even seemingly simple notifications like this can be quite harmful and damaging to people. No, it's not great news. I'm really struggling financially, so I have less money to spend. Stop telling me about your offers when I'm fasting. I can't eat right now. I don't want to lose weight. It's the opposite. I'm actually trying so hard not to. I know I didn't forget to log my period, but thanks for reminding me that I'm struggling with my hormones. So, as we mentioned, I want to talk to you today about these three words. So, on the left, we have things like unhappy path and edge case. And generally in our day-to-day roles, whether it's working with different people, so PMS or researchers, engineers, designers, whatever your role might be, these words on the left, so unhappy path and edge case, are generally said as annoying things. We say things like, oh, it's only 1% of users or that's probably not going to happen. It's an edge case. We won't prioritize it right now. But then on the right, we have delight. And as an industry, delight is put on a bit of a pedestal because as designers, we are encouraged to create experiences that are delightful because businesses think that that will help with things like conversion and loyalty and retention and all of those lovely business buzzwords. But actually, I'm here today to talk to you about how it's not just about delight in order to create good or great experiences. It's about understanding where people are in their journey and meeting them there. And that's not always delightful and it doesn't need to be. What I'll go through today is talking about how we need to understand people's emotions, behaviors, and context across the whole experience. Now, the reason why I'll be talking about emotions, behaviors, and context as a three is because generally what we do influences how we feel or how we feel influences what we do. So the three of them come together and it's really really important to think about those as as one and the same. But before I go any further, I just want to give a quick intro as to who I am and why I'm so passionate about edge cases and anti delight and all of that kind of stuff. So hey, I'm Emily and across my career so far, I've worked in some of these industries. Um I've worked in finance, gambling, health and social care and marketplaces. Now it seems quite random and some of them seem very very different to each other but there's been two things that have connected them together and that has been risk and emotion. I've seen the direct impact that products and services can have on people's lives both really positively and to be honest with you really quite negatively and it's really shamed uh shaped how I think and approach design as my mindset constantly thinking about what can go wrong and that's what I want to share with you today. I've also had to see how emotion can shape experiences, both very good emotion and very bad emotion. And it's core to my process. And I fundamentally believe that we should all be thinking about emotion a lot more. But the main reason I'm here and the main reason I talk a lot about this is because of my own experiences as a consumer and as a user of different products and services. So I want to share a few of my stories with you today. So without further ado, this is my first story. So, meet Lynn and Roger. Now, you might be able to tell hopefully that I'm in this photo and these are my grandparents. Now, unfortunately, a few years ago, my granddad sadly passed away. And it was a really, really difficult time for myself and my family, as you can imagine. As part of that process, and I'll call it a process, we had to go through and unsubscribe and cancel a lot of his subscription services. So, that meant things like either canceling them completely, downgrading usage, so from two accounts uh to one account or changing things from my granddad's name into my grandma's name. It was really difficult. It was really stressful and it was incredibly emotionally charged. But what made it worse was every single time we cancelled something, we got email after email after email saying things like this. It's not goodbye. You're still you're not with us anymore, but you're still part of the family. We hope you come back in the future. We'd love you to come back one day. Did you make a mistake? We even had one that said, \"Don't let your lazy self take over.\" Now, I've never seen my grandma so upset and angry before. And to be completely honest, I've never felt so responsible for my industry before. And I didn't say it in these words, but I was thinking, you are just an offboarding unhappy path that hasn't been considered or hasn't been prioritized because you don't directly link to money essentially. And I had to say to her, you know, you are not being made fun of. this is just a template. Somebody just hasn't cared about offboarding. And what we actually found was in that moment, in some scenarios, it was 15 years of loyalty and trust was broken. My grandma had been a customer, a very loyal customer to some companies for 15 years. And in that moment, she felt like it was faceless organizations that didn't care about her anymore. Whenever they wanted something, they cared about her and she was part of the family. But as soon as she indicated she wanted to leave, that was it. And in that moment, we didn't need delight. We didn't even need a great experience. But what we really needed was understanding, clarity, trust, and just a human experience. Understanding the reasons and the context as to why we might be cancelling. I think quite often in products and services we very quickly assume that people leave because they want to wherein sometimes people leave because they have to. So in our scenario we left because of a loss or actually in some scenarios people's ability might change and therefore they can't use the product or service anymore. and to make people feel bad about it or to not consider that there might be a different reason as to people's leaving I think is a huge opportunity to think about how we can make that experience a lot better. Now, the second story I want to give before I go on to things that a little bit more actionable later in the talk, um, is you won't be able to tell right now because you can only see from my shoulders up. Um, but I am currently pregnant and I'm expecting my first baby in a few months, which is very exciting and very scary at the same time. If anyone has any tips, please let me know. Um, but part of that whole experience of trying to conceive is full of emotion as you can imagine and I want to share a few of those stories with you. So, you may or may not have seen before depending on who you are and what types of apps you use for example, but there is an app similar to this um particularly in female health tracking where you can go in and you can log your menstrual cycle. So that's your period and you can basically be told when are you um most fertile. So when's your highest chances of getting pregnant and then also when is your period predicted? So when should you take a pregnancy test and things like that. So I came into the app one day to say okay unfortunately my period had arrived which therefore meant it was another month of being unsuccessful. And as soon as I opened the app I was greeted with this. Did you know about pregnancy mode? Yes. Yes, I did. All I've been trying to do for a period of time is to change to that mode. That's all I want to do. I didn't need to be informed about it again. Particularly on such an emotional day, the day when it could have been a really great day or in my scenario, unfortunately, it was a sign that it was another month of being unsuccessful. Now it might look like a really small thing and it's just words but in those moments it made me realize that actually we need to consider the emotions and the different states that people could be going through and perhaps that one day and the few days around that day when it's very very emotionally charged. We need to be very very careful with the types of language we use and the content that we show people. Now what could they have done instead? So firstly they could have considered the timing and experience level. So, as I mentioned, showing on day one perhaps isn't the most appropriate thing to do. So, perhaps delay it for a few days later if you need to do that. I think quite often in products and services, it's very very easy to say, we'll just put it in a modal or just put it in a pop-up, which firstly we know are not accessible anyway. But we're also forcing content onto people to read that content when they might not be in a state where they're able to um consume the content how they want to. but also consider the difference of experiences levels. So, as a little bit of context, I've been a user of that particular app for about four years and was very very well aware of all of the different modes, all of the different settings that they had. So, actually people that had been on that journey for a while might not need as much strong nudges um as people that might be new users, for example. So, think about the different types of experience levels that people different people might have. The other thing you can do is think about users engagement. So, as I mentioned, I think sometimes the easiest thing that people say is, \"Let's just put it in a modal and we'll make people read it.\" But actually, considering that on that screen they had a carousel, which meant that you could scroll through and we could make a pretty good assumption that if people are scrolling through, then they are actively wanting to read the content, which means that then they will probably be okay to to be informed about pregnancy mode, for example. or use trigger-based usage. So, for example, when you if if and when you um do get a positive pregnancy test, you're probably going to go into the app and say, \"Yep, I got it.\" From there, you can then if you're trying to encourage people to switch modes, you can then trigger that extra information to say, you know, congratulations on the positive test. How about you switch to this mode now? And that's where I think sometimes different business goals are really interesting because I'm not in the organization, but I imagine that there is one uh the the pregnancy team is very different to the trying to conceive team and they're trying to encourage adoption and you know nudge you to different ways but really thinking about how users might be feeling in different states and the impact that might have um on the overall user experience. Now the next one and the last story as I mentioned is a little bit more sensitive. So as part of my journey unfortunately I did experience a miscarriage and for those of you who might not know what that means it essentially means uh a while ago I was pregnant and then unfortunately was no longer pregnant. So I went into the app to say unfortunately I'm no longer pregnant which you can see on that bottom left screenshot there. After I clicked that I was then given this screen which asked me what I wanted to do with the data. Did I want to save it or did I want to delete it? And that's pretty good to be honest because that's giving you control of what do you want to do with it. It's not making you see the content. It's not dictating how you should interact with it. It's giving you the choice which is great from a control perspective. So I made my choice and then after that I noticed that my goal changed. My goal changed back to track cycle which in my scenario wasn't accurate because I wanted to go back to get pregnant again. And as soon as I clicked get pregnant, I was given this. Congratulations on taking the next step. Lots of confetti everywhere, lots of joy, lots of excitement. And what happened next? Well, to be honest, I just wanted to delete the app. In that moment, I thought, if you are smart enough to be able to predict my body, my anatomy of when I should be the most fertile, you should be smart enough to predict that after I've just told you what I've gone through, I don't need celebrating about getting back on the journey again. And that's when it's really, really important to think about if you've gone through the onboarding journey, we don't perhaps need to surf it surface it to you again. but also what are the different emotions that people could be feeling and how could we tailor those different experiences to you rather than a a one-sizefits-all approach. Now, for the next part of the talk, it's going to be a lot more lighter, I promise. Um, and I want to talk a bit more around what we can actually do as designers, researchers, PMs, whatever your role is, developers to be able to think about more inclusive and more um, meaningful experiences. Now, the big caveat here is I'm not saying that we can design every scenario and every situation because obviously there are limitless scenarios of what people can be experiencing. But what I am saying is I think generally as an industry we need to have more awareness of and be more intentional around what people could experiencing and therefore we can then look at how might that impact them. What's the likelihood of it? What's the risk and be just more conscious about it. So how can we think about these different scenarios and how can we embed this thinking thinking about emotions behaviors and context in our day-to-day process. So the first thing we can do is we can ask do we really know who we're designing for? Now I know that sounds obvious because of course we need to understand who are we designing for and we'll use things like personas and behavioral archetypes and lots of other things like that. But really getting to the root of do we actually know who we're designing for is really important. So one thing I like to do is consider lenses. Now, not to add more jargon or more frameworks to uh people's plates, one thing I like to do is use lenses. And that's essentially looking at the different scenarios or you know physically putting on some lenses um to consider how might this person be experienc it versus how might that person be experiencing it. And it's really to acknowledge that actually you might be the same person but you might be in a different situation depending on the time of day. So I might be somebody different in the morning or somebody different in the evening. I'm fundamentally still Emily, but my needs are going to change and what I need from the app changes. So to give you an example, let's use um let's say you've got a an app that helps people to have recipes at home. So your users are at home cooks. Instead of just making a very high level persona to say that at home cooks, these are their needs, these are the goals, pain points, behaviors, all of that kind of stuff, you can break it down into these different types of categories. So you could come at it from an experience level perspective. So you could say through the lens of experience, what might different people need? So they might be the learner, they're a very new cook, for example, or they're low confidence or they might be advanced. and you can start to pull out the different needs that they have, the different pains, the different goals and considerations. Or you might look at it through social context and you might say, \"Okay, well, what might the family cook need versus the solo cook?\" And as I mentioned, you might move through these lenses as a user. You might be a solo cook from Monday to Thursday and then a family cook from Friday to Sunday. So, you're fundamentally the same user, but your needs are changing. Or you could look through it through the lens of emotional state. So you might have, for example, the midweek panic. Or lastly, you could look through the lens of the environment. So the physical environment that somebody is in. So you could say the tiny kitchen versus the well equipped. Or you might say something like the one that has no signal or the one that's out running in the rain, for example, like that. They're very external factors of the environment that somebody is in. And what you can really start to do is rather than saying we are designing for this user, you can start to see the overlap of how the lenses will benefit multiple scenarios and multiple situations. So when you're prioritizing features or extra parts of functionality or anything like that, you can start to say well actually this piece of um functionality will benefit the social context which is the family cook and midweek panic and actually the the learner. Or actually you can also see where they start to conflict each other as well and say do you know what we are not going to be prioritizing this lens because of X reason. Now I normally like to use between five to seven lenses that normally helps to give some really good context for the different types of um scenarios people might be going through. So you don't need to have hundreds of these. Try and keep them as as limited as you can. Um, but it just really really helps you to think about these different types of themes um that to to look from and it doesn't have to be big sexy features. I think quite often in design particularly we think that everything has to be really really innovative but actually sometimes the smallest things can be the most helpful and the most meaningful to people. So a few examples, if I go back to the period tracking app, there is something that I think is actually brilliant is when you go into the notifications, you can completely customize which notifications you want on or off. So instead of I want all notifications on, you can say, okay, I want to be reminded of period in a couple of days and I want to be reminded of the period end, for example. If you go into that notification itself, you can actually then customize the text. So of what the notification actually says and you can set the reminder time. So you can say I want the notification to say you be kind to yourself and I want that to be delivered at 10:00. If we look at that from a lens perspective, you can see how it starts to benefit lots of different scenarios. So being able to toggle on which notification you might have somebody that has an irregular cycle versus somebody that is regular or you might be somebody that is forgetful and actually you want to have that specific notification on the text will help with an emotional state perspective. So, I think sometimes even with the best will in the world, we can write great content that we think is is helpful to people, but actually we want to make sure that it's not triggering to anyone. And somebody might decide if they're particularly anxious around that sort of time of the month. Giving them the ability to write their own message will help to alleviate some of that anxiety. Or if you look at it from a privacy perspective, imagine you're you're a kid and you take your phone to school. The last thing you want is your phone to be popping up saying, \"Hey, your period's about to arrive.\" So, they might want to customize it with a code word, for example. Or the time you might have, if we look from the lens of um environment or privacy, again, you might have somebody that doesn't want their phone to notify them during certain hours of the day. Perhaps they're in school, perhaps they're in work. or the lens from the forgetfulness is again let's say they're going out for the day and they need to take certain things with them being able to schedule that notification for 6:00 in the morning before they leave can be really really helpful. So suddenly you can start to see how not only is it benefiting the user type of, you know, I want to track my cycle, you can really start to break it down for all of these different scenarios that people might be in and how it can benefit lots and lots of different situations. Or another example is with Strava. So if you don't know, Strava is an app that helps you to log your workouts and runs and share it with your friends and your followers. Now, when you post an individual run, you can choose exactly who can view it. So, everyone, my followers, or me. And you might immediately say, okay, that's great from a privacy perspective because I want to control who can see what I do. But you could also look at it through the lens of motivation and emotion. And we live in unfortunately such a world of comparison culture where if people are perhaps a little bit slower than they would have liked, they might or have a bad workout, they might feel judged. But giving them the ability to share it to only themselves because of understanding how they might be feeling and how their motivation might change suddenly will keep people using the product or service. So keep people using Straa instead of them deleting it for example. So, we're giving them that control. Or another example I love to give is InPost. Now, if you don't know what InPost is, it's similar to Amazon lockers. Um, the concept is essentially there's a big wall of lockers. You can go and send and receive parcels from there. And when you do that, there is a little check box at the bottom that says, I need a low compartment. And that benefits lots of different scenarios. So, for example, you might have wheelchair users. So, people that can't reach very high if they are using a wheelchair. You might have people that are situationally impaired. So, let's say they've got a heavy box and they can't actually lift it into that higher compartment. Or you might have people that are just different heights. Maybe they're shorter or maybe they're a child. So again, by starting to look from these different lens perspectives, you can say, not only does this one feature help with people that have, for example, wheelchair users, it can also help with a bunch of these different scenarios. And it's really important to consider if lenses are in tension with each other. Um, I think sometimes it's very easy to look at what are the user needs, but we also really need to show where um lenses can be in conflict. So, as an example, when I worked in social care, we had a app that essentially had um it allowed care managers, sorry, it allowed care managers to who were in the office to plan the care that the patient would receive that connected to an app which allowed carers to go into the house and then basically report back on what care they delivered. Now, you might think those two things are can work pretty well and seamlessly together. What we didn't realize until we started thinking about lenses was for some of the people in the office, they fell under the kind of persona type of gonna say a bit of a micromanager and wanting to know as much information as possible. And when we looked through the lens of carers and we looked through the lens of time, we realized that some carers are incredibly time poor. So suddenly you have two lenses that are in complete conflict with each other. You've got one that wants to know as much information as possible and you've got one that doesn't have much time at all to provide that information. And you can you can then use those lenses to say okay well which situation are we prioritizing? How can we meet in the middle? Um and yeah, what are the the pros and cons of each essentially the next thing we can do is we can ask what can go wrong. Now, if there's anything I would love anyone to take away from today is to be consciously aware and constantly ask what could go wrong and we can do that through different ways. So the first one is we can really zoom out to the macro view. And one thing I love to do is when I'm creating anything like a journey map, experience map, service blueprint, any kind of map is I love to add a risks row, which is essentially a row along your journey map that makes you consciously stop every single point and ask what could go wrong. And that might be somebody's going to move from the house to outside. they're going to lose signal or you know they're running and they can't I don't know if their eyes are blurry so they can't actually see the screen very much or whatever it is but it's just something to be able to make you slow down and conscious cons consciously question what could go wrong from there you can then assess things like what's the likelihood of that happening what's the impact of it happening do we need to go to do more research to prove or disprove our assumptions but it helps you to really try and brainstorm at that point of these different scenarios people could be experiencing. An example of this is when I was in Thailand earlier this year. Um, very great trip. Had the privilege of going there and I was at the airport and I needed to order a Grab. So, if you've not heard of it before, that's similar to an Uber. So, it's essentially you're ordering a taxi kind of on demand. And when I put in my location, I was told I had to be at the right place at the right time because we were going to get fined if not. And I thought, \"Okay, I'm on the blue dot. I'm standing there. It says where I am.\" Except when the car arrived, I started getting lots of messages from my driver in Thai. They were quite angry messages saying, \"You're not where you are. Where are you?\" And I was thinking, \"I am.\" I didn't realize that actually I was in a multi-story car park and I was on completely the wrong floor. So although geographically I was in the right position, I was just completely the wrong level down. And in that moment I was absolutely panicking because although there was a way to translate words, there wasn't a really easy way at all to communicate with my words to tell you I don't know where I am. So how do you tell someone where you are when you don't know where you are? you don't know how to get to where you need to be and you don't say speak the same language. Well, actually they had this little um piece of functionality. So, when my visual when my verbal communication was impaired, I relied on visual visually communicating. And what we did instead was I essentially took photos and then the the taxi driver would either thumbs up or thumbs down if I was going in the right direction. And it was actually really really helpful all by thinking about what could go wrong in that scenario. It's something I hadn't considered before, but it was actually really great. The other thing we can do is we can zoom into the micro view. So when I'm designing, what I love to do is create a component, something similar to this in Figma or your design tool of choice or even if it's in a Word document, whatever it is, is to basically have a component that said the risk theme. So maybe it's will a user understand this? Do they is there a usability issue? Um can they understand the icon? Is that going to be misunderstood? Then what's the risk, the likelihood, and the trade-off? So you'll see there's recurring themes around, okay, what's the risk? Is it going to happen? What's the impact of it? And then how might we potentially solve that? And a way it's again to make you slow down, comb through your designs, and think, could something go wrong here? and do we need to go and do more research off the back of that. It also helps with documentation as well. So if you've made a decision, you can say we think this might happen. We'll keep an eye out for it when we launch it and we'll have to roll it back or whatever it is when it gets released. But it helps you to show that you have consciously thought about these different scenarios. We also need to acknowledge our biases. We need to make room for voices outside of our own experiences. I think sometimes it's really easy to design and say that won't happen or there that's probably not likely to happen. But actually user journeys are messier and way more diverse than we expect. So an example I like to give is when I worked in social care going back to that um app where carers would go into people's houses into patients houses and they would log um different information about the patient. And one of those things was going in and logging the patient's mood. Now, this looks like a very basic screen. It was basically just an icon and the label of what the icon meant. And then the carers would go through and click and say, \"This person was happy or they were sad or they were excited or anything like that.\" And it was a way to track how the patient might be changing their emotion over time. And it was also a way for the uh patients family to see how they might be feeling, particularly if they lived uh far away. And as the design team, we went through the usual things that design teams do and we say, \"Okay, we're going to do a refresh of our app. We're going to change how we um use icons. We're going to change our styling. All of that kind of stuff.\" And we decided that actually these icons were way too big, and they weren't really surface uh weren't really fit for purpose, and we might use a list view instead. What we realized when we were doing a lot of research was actually there's quite a lot of carers particularly in the UK that English isn't their first language and actually they were relying on these visual icons to understand the context of the screen and they weren't even reading the labels at all. And it completely reframed how we thought about our icon usage across the whole app. Because not only did some people think that they were there just to visually make the screen look a little bit nicer or, you know, break up the content on the screen, it actually made us realize that some people relied completely on the visual communication within the app. And it was a really great point and sort of learning moment for our team. So, we have to really acknowledge our biases and try and make sure when we're doing things like user testing, as has been mentioned earlier, we try and make sure that we have a diverse group of people that we test with and get their input from so that we're not just designing for our own needs. And the last thing on this bit around what can go wrong is I think it's really important to think about that in our day-to-day processes as well. So, not just what an a user might be experiencing, but also how are we how are we operating within the business. And I think that one of the most important things is to not just rely on data. So, let's say you've got a service that allows people to book um medical appointments. You might say, okay, well, looking at the data, 95% of people didn't click reschedu and only 5% of people clicked it. Therefore, there is not a problem with this screen. Well, actually, we need to question the why behind those datas. What might be happening? Why could people not be clicking it? And you might then suddenly realize that people don't know what the next step is. They're really anxious that they might lose the appointment or they might not be able to get another one for weeks time. So, they don't click it out of fear. So instead of just saying we are relying on this data, we can use it to be data informed, but we absolutely need to be questioning our own decisions internally to say how confident are we that that is giving us a true representation of what users are actually experiencing. And the last section is around connecting the user impact to the business impact. Now, I know not everything can be measured, and I know businesses love to measure absolutely everything, but if we can when we're designing things that are a little bit more inclusive, really try and say how it actually is a benefit to the business as well. You know, accessibility, inclusive design benefits everyone. One of my favorite examples that I like to give is Pinterest. Now, a few I think it was about 6 months ago, um they released this feature and this functionality called body types. So, if you were to search for an item of clothing, let's say a black dress or a red dress or whatever it is, this fe this filter will appear just underneath your search bar that then allows you to choose which type of body you want to browse with. From an inclusive design perspective, it's brilliant because you can then see people that represent um a body like yours and you don't have to worry about seeing other bodies that might could potentially be triggering to you depending on your relationship with how you feel about yourself. So from a user impact perspective, when you're sort of pitching for this idea, you might say, well, if users select the body type they want to browse with, then they will see images that better represent themselves, which means they are less likely hopefully to feel negative towards their own body. Brilliant. What you can also do, if possible, is try and then say how it's good for the business, too. So if users see the images and they enjoy seeing those images, they will spend more time browsing. So we will then get higher engagement from users who previously felt excluded, they will then have longer browsing sessions, which means they will see more ads, which means there will be more revenue. Now, I'm not saying that inclusive design has to constantly um show that it directly in impacts revenue and things like that. But if there is a way to show how it is beneficial, then tying those two things together can be really really helpful and really powerful. Or if we go back to the straa example, so the one I showed many many minutes ago, if we go back through the lens of motivation, so you say that okay, if users have a bad workout, if we enable them to control what they share, then actually that will encourage them to keep using the app rather than them deleting it, falling off the the motivational bandwagon as people say, and actually it will help to preserve their engagement and maybe reduce churn. sort of keep that habit and will keep them using it. So, not only is it good from a privacy perspective, but actually it's still really good from a usage perspective as well. So, as a quick recap, because I know I've talked about a lot of different things, here are some things you can help to do in your day-to-day process. So, you can consider people's different perspectives, and I like to use lenses, um, or things like behavioral archetypes will help us with that as well. If you can really try and zoom out to consider the wider system or zoom in to consider the micro. So it's a constant state of looking at the overall experience in the environment somebody is in versus looking at the individual screen that you're designing for. You can consider where we can give users more control and more autonomy. So rather than us dictating what the experience can be, how can we help users to say this is how I want my experience to be. this is the type of control I I want to tell you how I want to experience it. We can acknowledge our biases and we can not just rely on data. We can constantly ask what can go wrong and from there we can consider the risk, the impact and the trade-off. We can do things like you know like I said doing a follow-up research. We can do assumptions mapping and things like that. But constantly asking what can go wrong can really help you to uncover some of those scenarios and we can connect the user to the business impact hopefully. Like I said, I know not everything can be measured, but if you really try and ladder it up to those broader business goals when you're pitching things about inclusive design, when you're pitching things about accessibility, can be really, really powerful to show how it's not only good for users, that inclusive design is good for business, too. So, I want to leave you with one of my favorite quotes. If you have or haven't read the book before, it's um a book called Mismatch by Cat Holmes. I would absolutely recommend it. It's a really thin book, very easy to skim through. One of the quotes is, \"For better or worse, the people who design the touch points of society determine who can participate and who's left out.\" And I think that's really powerful because anybody that works in tech, regardless of what your role is, we all have a responsibility to try and make experiences more inclusive, more meaningful, and more useful by the people that are experiencing them. We do hold such a great power, which I think sometimes we forget. And I think this just really helps to reinforce that. So, it's not just about delight. It's about making those bad moments less bad. It's about making those neutral moments better and it's about making those good moments great. So yes, absolutely think about delight, but let's think about the entire experience and how people might not always be going through moments that are delightful and how can we meet them where they are. So in order to create great experiences, we need to just remember that it's about designing for people always. Thank you very much. Hey, that is really great. Um because uh because I think that oftentimes, you know, we're often we're often told to like sought happy experiences here. And I think that that's, you know, oftentimes some like like a hard goalpost to really reach for >> um especially considering, you know, the wide complex range of human emotions that we can en encounter uh with our our users in like specifically. I love that you say that there's no way that we can account for every single thing that can go go wrong. It's good to ask that, but maybe we can't, you know, anticipate every single story that might happen. Um to what extent are mistakes simply part of the product you know in that sense? >> Oh wow. Do you mean that so they've either like not just in they've intentionally not been thought about and it just is how the product works or is it just because thing is going through >> Okay. Um yeah I think that's a good question. I think that sometimes the most um sometimes the most insight might look insignificant on the surface can actually have a really impact to somebody depending on the scenario that you're in. Like I said, it's not every we can't account for every scenario that somebody is in. But I think that a lot of the times is when we say that's just how the product is is because things have just been built because they haven't actually considered the real experience and how somebody's interacting with those. And it might be legacy product. It might be because there was no design time or it was just rushed out the door or anything like that. But it's almost not an excuse. Like I think that quite often we just say, \"Oh, that is what it is and people will just have to deal with it.\" But sometimes like we are all people too and we all experience things and we are probably more critical of products and services because we say why is that designed like that? Um, and I think that there just needs to be more intention around is this something that if it does negatively impact somebody that it it might be okay or actually is this something that we really really need to be careful about because of the industry that we're in or the scenario that somebody could be going going through, >> you know. Um, on top of that, it makes me think too that it's equally important to consider how we how we respond to those mistakes >> um than it is to avoid them in the first place. like for for for teams or even anyone here watching today who wants to account for these types of things that can go wrong. What's the best way to solicit that sort of feedback and have the shortest gap possible between realizing that there's there's a scenario to account for and then getting that feedback and implementing it. >> Yeah. So, I think there's two things to that I think. Firstly is first you can try and do as much upfront prep as you can. Obviously, you can never fully anticipate through research how things will be used because as people we it's hard to predict what your behavior might be and even when you do research sometimes it's very hard to say okay we have absolutely eliminated all the risk but sometimes it's great to try and bolster that up front and say we've minimized this as much as we can and then from a secondary perspective is like I said when you're going through and designing things if there's anything that you think you're slightly worried worried about is to really heavily monitor firstly the data to say is this behaving how we think it might be is it not I know you can't get things like how people are feeling from a data from a data point you can just see graphs and things like that um but sometimes using even just like social platforms like people be really really vocal on things like Reddit on Tik Tok on wherever to tell you hey this has impacted me in this way and you can really start to pay attention to those kind of social channels sometimes as well. Um or like I said then try and recruit some of users that you know are actively using your product and reach out to them and understand rather than how would you use this be like tell me a scenario of the last time that you booked a flight using our product or service and you start to then feel the emotional journey that they're going through. You know, I have a feeling that there's going to be a lot of great synced up uh discussion here between you and and Michelle, especially when it comes to how we pro how we plan and prototype um in advance u to help, you know, account for some of these scenarios up front or just avoid awkward situations in the first place. and then how we can, you know, use tools to >> help that cycle, you know, rinse, wash, and and repeat as as we saw with with Marcel. So, I actually want to want to welcome folks back up to the the stage here.",
