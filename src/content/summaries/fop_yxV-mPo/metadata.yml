title: "The Codebase Singularity: “My agents run my codebase better than I can”"
description: >-
  What if your agents could run your codebase BETTER than you ever could? 🤯


  This is the codebase singularity - the moment you realize you trust your AI
  agents to ship more than you trust yourself or your team.


  In this sneak peak from Agentic Horizon Lesson 6, we break down the three
  concrete classes of the agentic layer and show you exactly how to scale from a
  basic setup to a full orchestrator-driven system.

  IndyDevDan here, the final lesson is here: Agentic Horizon Lesson 6 (TAC 14)
  is officially live on (link below).


  Huge thanks to every engineer that's a member and has taken Tactical Agentic
  Coding and Agentic Horizon.


  For all non-members, this video is a sneak peak of the full lesson available
  to Agentic Horizon members.


  If you're interested you can unlock this lesson and others by purchasing
  Tactical Agentic Coding AND Agentic Horizon.


  Let me be clear, TAC and AH is not for beginners. See the landing page for
  more details.

  💡 BUILD YOUR AGENTIC LAYER

  - Tactical Agentic Coding:
  https://agenticengineer.com/tactical-agentic-coding?y=fop_yxV-mPo


  🔥 The agentic layer is the new ring around your codebase where you teach your
  agents to operate your application on your behalf. When you build this layer
  correctly, something incredible happens: your codebase starts running itself.


  🚀 In this video, we break down the three concrete classes of the agentic
  layer and show you exactly how to scale from a basic setup to a full
  orchestrator-driven system. From class one grade one (just a prime prompt and
  memory files) all the way to class three with multi-agent orchestration -
  we're mapping the entire journey.


  🛠️ Watch as we demonstrate an orchestrator agent kicking off AI developer
  workflows, running plan-build-review-fix cycles, and building entire
  applications in one shot. This is tactical agentic coding taken to the next
  level.


  💡 Key Concepts Covered:


  Agentic Layer: The new outer ring of your codebase where agents drive your
  engineering

  Codebase Singularity: The moment your agents run your code better than you can

  Agentic Horizon: The future where your codebase runs itself

  Multi-Agent Systems: Orchestrator agents controlling AI developer workflows

  Agent Orchestration: Building systems where agents coordinate and execute
  complex tasks

  Classes and Grades: A framework for measuring your agentic layer's power


  🌟 Whether you're just starting with a prime prompt or building sophisticated
  multi-agent systems, understanding the agentic layer is the highest ROI action
  for any engineer in the age of AI. We break down every grade and class from 1
  to 5, showing you exactly what your codebase structure should look like at
  each level.


  ⚡ From memory files to custom tools, from skills and MCP servers to
  closed-loop prompts that self-correct - this is your sneak peak of the
  complete guide to building the agentic layer that transforms how you engineer
  forever.


  Stay focused and Keep Building.
