  description: "What if your agents could run your codebase BETTER than you ever could? 🤯


    This is the codebase singularity - the moment you realize you trust your AI agents to ship more than you trust yourself or your team.

    💡 BUILD YOUR AGENTIC LAYER

    - Tactical Agentic Coding: https://agenticengineer.com/tactical-agentic-coding?y=fop_yxV-mPo


    🔥 The agentic layer is the new ring around your codebase where you teach your agents to operate your application on your behalf. When you build this layer correctly, something incredible happens: your codebase starts running itself.


    🚀 In this video, we break down the three concrete classes of the agentic layer and show you exactly how to scale from a basic setup to a full orchestrator-driven system. From class one grade one (just a prime prompt and memory files) all the way to class three with multi-agent orchestration - we're mapping the entire journey.


    🛠️ Watch as we demonstrate an orchestrator agent kicking off AI developer workflows, running plan-build-review-fix cycles, and building entire applications in one shot. This is tactical agentic coding taken to the next level.


    💡 Key Concepts Covered:


    Agentic Layer: The new outer ring of your codebase where agents drive your engineering

    Codebase Singularity: The moment your agents run your code better than you can

    Agentic Horizon: The future where your codebase runs itself

    Multi-Agent Systems: Orchestrator agents controlling AI developer workflows

    Agent Orchestration: Building systems where agents coordinate and execute complex tasks

    Classes and Grades: A framework for measuring your agentic layer's power


    🌟 Whether you're just starting with a prime prompt or building sophisticated multi-agent systems, understanding the agentic layer is the highest ROI action for any engineer in the age of AI. We break down every grade and class from 1 to 5, showing you exactly what your codebase structure should look like at each level.


    ⚡ From memory files to custom tools, from skills and MCP servers to closed-loop prompts that self-correct - this is your sneak peak of the complete guide to building the agentic layer that transforms how you engineer forever.


    Stay focused and Keep Building.

## Key Takeaways

Engineering is shifting from writing code to building autonomous systems that operate codebases through a structured **Agentic Layer**.

*   The **Agentic Layer** acts as a wrapper around the application layer (frontend, backend, and DB), allowing agents to maintain global context.

*   To reach the **Codebase Singularity**, developers must move beyond basic prompting and implement **closed-loop cycles** (Request, Validate, Resolve).

*   The **Core 4 Framework**—Context, Model, Prompt, and Tools—is the foundation for designing agent capabilities and specialized skills.

*   Scaling **compute and feedback loops** is the primary way to increase confidence in agentic output, moving from generic plans to specialized review agents.

## Summary

Indy

Dev

Dan introduces the concept of the **Agentic Layer**, a strategic framework designed to transform how engineers interact with their software. This layer exists outside the traditional application code (the frontend, backend, and database) and serves as the command center where AI agents are trained to operate the codebase. The ultimate goal is the **Codebase Singularity**, a threshold where agents become more reliable at shipping and maintaining production code than the human developers themselves.

### The Maturity Model: Class 1, Grades 1-5
The video breaks down the evolution of an agentic system into specific grades, allowing developers to audit their current progress:

*   **Grade 1 (The Foundation):** The thinnest layer, consisting of a **Prime Prompt** and **Memory Files** (e.g., `claud.md`). This provides the agent with immediate context but offers limited autonomy.

*   **Grade 2 (Planning and Sub-agents):** Introduces specialized prompts and sub-agents for tasks like documentation fetching and test writing. This level adds a **Specs directory** for planning work before execution.

*   **Grade 3 (Tooling and Skills):** Integrates **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** and custom **Skills**. This allows agents to interact with the real world via CLI commands, database migrations, or starting/stopping applications.

*   **Grade 4 (Closed-Loop Feedback):** The most critical jump for reliability. It implements **Request-Validate-Resolve** loops where agents review their own work, reproduce bugs in isolated environments, and output resolution logs.

*   **Grade 5 (Scale):** Focuses on managing the fragmentation of growing codebases by specializing agents for specific domains like client-side vs. server-side logic.

### Designing Agentic Tools
A major pitfall identified is the over-engineering of tools. Dan emphasizes that **MCP servers** can often be replaced by simple, well-written prompts that teach an agent how to use existing CLI tools. The focus should be on **Context Engineering** and ensuring tools are not too "token-heavy," which can burn through API budgets without adding value. By treating the agentic layer as a first-class citizen in the repository, developers can parallelize workflows and achieve higher autonomy.

## Context

This video addresses the transition from 'AI-assisted coding' (using tools like Copilot) to 'Agentic Engineering,' where the AI takes a proactive role in the development lifecycle. As LLMs become more capable of reasoning, the bottleneck is no longer the model itself, but the architecture surrounding it. This matters to software engineers, CTOs, and solo developers who want to scale their output without increasing headcount. It aligns with the broader industry trend toward **Autonomous Software Engineering**, moving codebases toward a state where they are self-documenting, self-testing, and self-healing. Understanding the agentic layer is essential for staying relevant as the 'human-in-the-loop' role shifts toward system orchestration rather than manual syntax writing.
