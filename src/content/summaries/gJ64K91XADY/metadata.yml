title: AI Marketing Isn't As Scary As You Think | The Marketer's Roundtable
description: >-
  If you've been doing SEO, running social ads, or optimizing for any algorithm,
  you've already been doing AI marketing. The panic around AI agents and machine
  learning is overblown because marketers have been marketing to machines for
  over a decade.


  In this marketing roundtable, My team and I break down why AI isn't the
  revolution everyone thinks it is. It's an evolution of what you're already
  doing. The real difference? Machines are more thorough than humans. They read
  everything. And that means your data infrastructure needs to be airtight.


  Key Takeaways:


  - Why SEO and algorithm optimization already prepared you for AI marketing

  - The fundamental shift: marketing to "Man AND Machines" has been happening
  since Google launched

  - How AI agents pull from the same content you've already optimized for search
  engines

  - Why data feeds and product information need to be more complete than ever

  - The difference between how humans consume content vs. how machines process
  it

  - Why being "thorough" is the new competitive advantage in AI-driven marketing

  - How marketing has evolved (and died) multiple times—and why this is just the
  next cycle
