  "fullText": "Hey, I'm Neil Patel and welcome to the marketers roundt where leading marketing experts from around the world speak about what's happening in today's world. And today I have the privilege of being with Nikki and Chad from NP digital to talk about search everywhere optimization. >> Hi, I'm Chad Gilbert. I'm vice president of content marketing at NP Digital. >> Hi, I'm Nikki Lamb, head of SEO at NP Digital. >> Today is our first episode of the marketing roundt and we're going to be talking about search everywhere optimization. Dude, you know, I learned about search optimization first seeing it from you, Nikki. And where did you first learn about it? >> So, I read about it on search engine land uh from a blog post from an Ashley Liddell who founded uh deviation agency in the UK. >> Girl or guy? Because I know Ashley can get both ways. >> Guy. Yeah. His co-founder Sam uh co-founded Deviation Agency and they're all about bringing together so social search and brand. So very cool concept from him. But I will say you learned about it from me. When you started talking about it, everybody started talking about it. So a lot of people give you credit even though you didn't. >> No, no, no. I I Yeah, I never created it. I learned it from you and I wasn't sure if you learned it from someone else or saw it on an article like on search engine journal or search engine land or anything like that. >> Yeah. But who cares who came up with it? It's important for every brand and I think every marketing agency should be talking to their clients about it >> and it is more than just one engine now. It is everywhere. So, it was the natural >> totally language, right? Like >> and props to Ashley for coming up with it. >> Yeah. >> Most people want to talk about AI SEO or like ranking on Chad GPT to be very specific. I really haven't seen too many people care about perplexity. After Chad GPT, they talk about Gemini, but when we actually talk to companies, I don't even think most of them know where Gemini even lives, >> right? Like when you talk to them about Gemini, they're just like, \"Uh, so Gemini is just ranking on Google.\" >> No, honestly, right, that's what like I don't think most people know where Gemini lives >> because they don't have to know because it's not driving traffic for brands. Looking at our NP digital clients, chatt is driving >> almost all of it, >> 85 95% of their AI referral traffic. So marketers haven't really had to care about Gemini because it's just not having the market share that Chacha BT has. >> Yeah. And do you think that with these AI platforms that people are going to call it a SEO, GEO, uh >> EIO? Yeah. Who knows? AEO because I know HubSpot's big on answer engine options. I've been >> profound. Profound is big on >> AEO. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I don't know what they're going to call it. What do you think is going to stick? I personally think calling it AI search optimization makes sense because then there's no confusion about what you're talking about. Sometimes you say GEO to somebody and they're like, \"What is that? What does that mean? That confuses me.\" If you just say AI search optimization, everybody gets it. >> Yeah, I agree with that. Now, when you look at these platforms, all right, and the client ends up saying, \"Hey, I'm looking for AI SEO or GE or SEO.\" I personally go with whatever vernacular the potential customer wants to talk about because SEOs have this take that it's all the same. It should just be called SEO. And I'm really in it where it's like, well, if you want the business, you better adapt because if you don't adapt, someone else is they're going to go to someone else who offers what they're looking for. Even though it could be the same thing, they're just calling something different, >> right? >> But I've been seeing a lot of SEOs online saying, I don't know why you guys are all calling it anything different. It's the same thing. There's no difference from doing SEO on Google with SEO on ChatG. Now, before I break down what I think, do you guys really think they're identical? It's the same exact thing. >> No. No, >> they're not identical. I think crossovers. >> Yeah. The argument is that a lot of the tactics and best practices that work for years on Google also help you with chat GBT. But a couple of things, JavaScript, right? If you've got a JavaScript heavy website, these AI crawlers can't see your content. So that's a fundamental technical difference between visibility for traditional Google and you know AI models like chatpt. The other thing is a lot of studies show that the the most cited websites in ChachiPT once you get through the big ones right YouTube and Reddit and you know the biggest brands in the world after that there's like not a high crossover between the brands ranking best in SEO and the brands ranking best in places like Chachu BT. I want to say the last study I saw was like 19% crossover. Um, and maybe it's because those 19% are doing SEO and a lot of the other brands aren't investing in SEO, but if it were the same exact thing, then you would see a higher percentage of crossover. Now, that doesn't mean, I think, that there aren't a lot of similarities. Like, when we look at what's working, we're doing a lot of 90day GEO sprints for clients all across the globe right now, and we're getting phenomenal results. A lot of the tactics are things that we might have done if it were just an SEO campaign anyway, >> like building back links and mentions offline for the brand and connecting it to those publishers. One thing that I think is interesting is you look back at SEO 10, 15 years ago with, you know, the black hat SEO backlink building tactics that would inject visibility for Google, right? We're seeing some of those same sites that might be considered spammy these days that are actually providing visibility in LLMs. So, I think that that'll pro they'll probably start cracking down on that because when you look at what some of those publishers have, it is a spam site. >> It it really is cuz right now I see a lot of companies and I wouldn't say this is spam. It depends how you want to classify it. I see a lot of companies releasing blog posts on their own website. >> Yes. >> That are listicles. So, whatever they're selling, it could be a service or product and they're just ranking themselves number one. Y and it's causing the LLM to site them more. Now, I wouldn't say that's spam. I would say that's somewhat biased content because who's not going to rank themselves number one? If you don't want to rank yourself number one, props to you for being really honest and truthful. But I haven't met a company today that wouldn't rank themselves number one. I'm assuming you guys agree with this. Yes. >> And that causes you to get mentions on these LLMs. But I don't think that'll carry forward, you know, call it a year from now. Yes, Google is definitely losing ground as the way that people start search because I have the chatbt app on my phone and when I need anything for the most part I go right to chatbt because I know that it's going to be better quality information. >> But what do you go for? You just said information like what are you actually using chat GBT for versus Google? >> I'm using ChatgBT to do what I used to do as a Google search, right? Uh last night my husband and I were like, \"What age does our kid get out of a car seat and into a booster?\" And he was googling and he's like, \"This answer doesn't make any sense. It's not giving me the right information.\" I said, \"That's because you're using Google and not CatchBT.\" And guess who gave us the right answer that we were looking for? Super fastt. >> But did you try AI mode? >> Ah, you know what? That's a good point. I don't know why I'd never think to use AI mode. And I think this is why our clients at NP Digital are seeing their AI referral traffic come from Chat GPT. It's not coming from Gemini. It's not coming from Perplexity. They >> they won the brand and mind share game. >> Yeah. >> But let's go back. You use it forformational searches >> and a lot more than that, right? >> Okay. So, what's a lot more? Is it like you're wearing jeans? Would you buy jeans from Ted G? did purchase something recently from Chachi, didn't you? >> I did get the best pillow ever. It was like a $200 pillow, which seems crazy, but I was having neck pain for like a year. And finally, I was like, \"Why do I have neck pain? Maybe I need a new pillow.\" To chat BT, I said, \"I have all these things. I had got a car accident before. I have neck pain. Is it my pillow? Oh, it might be my pillow. What pillows do you recommend?\" It gave me this pillow recommendation. Life-changing. I will tell every single person to buy this pillow. I need to find out what the pillow is. >> Do I remember the brand of the pillow? No. But every time I tell somebody about the pillow, when they're interested, I go back. I look at my, you know, my purchase and then I tell them life-changing pillow. >> So, I'm actually pulling this up from my chat GBT right now. I don't use the app. I just go to chatgbt.com, but I should use the app because I keep typing in chat go like it puts that in. I'm assuming O is next to P on the keyboard. or I need to. So I have asked this so many times in variation of this like my upper back hurts after sleeping on a firm mattress. I tried buying a softer mattress but it still hurts. What else can I try? And this is a thread when I sleep at a hotel my back is usually fine. And like I have so many uh conversations with Chad Jvi about my back. I have no joke change out the mattresses in my whole house. My kids mattresses, my mattress. >> They work. Um, my kids feel better. My wife's cool. I even bought like a topper. I tried buying toppers on the old mattress. Um, I got rid of the topper, slept with just the mattress, and my wife now likes the topper, and my back doesn't hurt without the topper. So, I use Chat GBT a lot like you, but mine is purely forformational searches when I'm trying to solve problems. But what did you make purchases based on the chat GPT recommendations? It sounds like you made many. >> I have, but not purchases that chat GBT recommended me. I use it to help me problem solve and then I tend to go to Google and Amazon to find what I'm looking to buy. I know they integrate with commerce, but it's a interface and I don't want to use it. >> We're not there yet. >> I don't think we're anywhere near there yet. Like >> it's not just we're not there yet. I think we're so far and we're ingrained in our head to just go to amazon.com and type in what we're looking for and price shop. Cuz if Chad GBT recommends something for me, I'll probably find something that's just like it on Amazon and I can read a review and it's half the cost. >> But the pillow that I bought, Chat GPT direct linked me to the product on Amazon and I looked at it, it had phenomenal reviews. I bought it right away. >> Text me the pillow link. >> I'm going to get I'll get you that pillow. For me in my searches, I mainly use it forformational product based searches. No. For general searches like um I was just looking up currency exchange. I'm not going to go to chat GBT for that. >> No. >> If I'm looking to send money to another country, I'm not going to go to chat GPT for it. I still find myself using Google. >> And when you go back to these searches like the car seat or I'm curious on the searches you do, I tend If I look at how Google worked in the past, I still use it for a lot of the searches I used to. Now my searches are becoming more complex >> on Google >> uh on chat GBT sometimes in AI mode. But there's this whole new slew of searches that I'm starting to perform that I never search >> before. Yeah. >> And I think that's the new evolution of search. But we're still doing a lot of our old searches and Google's data that shows that they now have over uh what 5 trillion searches a year. What 13.7 billion a day? >> Yeah, it's increasing. >> It's increasing. We're still using a lot of our old type of searches at least based on Google's data. still using Google, but there's a new type of search that we're performing now that's very in-depth, that's very specific, problem oriented, and you're looking for very in or you're looking for a solution based on a very uh specific problem that you can go really in-depth on. And I think a lot of us are using chat GPD for that. Yep, that's how I do it. And I still definitely go to Google um and I use AI mode in Google, but for those problem solving experiences where the prompt is deep and there's a lot of layers to it and there's follow-ups, that's chatt. And I think I go there first more when I'm at work because I am doing that in at work more often is solving those problems or figuring out those things, connecting dots in different ways. And then on a personal side, I think I typically will go to Google first still versus a chat GPT because I'm doing something different at home than I am when I'm working. So that's like my split I feel. >> So here's what I would tell a client. Who cares what you do, you do, or what I do? Their audience should dictate what they do. So if we have an >> brand who whose average consumer is 28 to 35 years old, guess where those you know that that's a random range that I picked, but like the younger generations, they're chatting, that's what they call it, right? They chat everything. They are not going to use Google. And our kids, Neil, our kids are probably not going to use Google. >> No, they use voice. Do your kids search uh through voice yet? >> Too young. My gosh. But yours probably do. >> Yes. They don't understand the typing >> and I think so. >> Yeah. Because then you're not going to a platform. It's whatever's connected with the device that you're using which >> Siri then >> uh it's either Siri or Alexa. >> Alexa. >> But my take on if Google is going to be the main search engine >> is similar to yours but with a little bit of a twist. So when people ask me I'm in agreement. I actually tell them who cares if Google wins or Chad GBT wins. Be everywhere. Right. which goes into search everywhere optimization. I have a little bit of a different take. So, if you're telling me ages 18 to 38 are not on Google or uh not on a specific platform, so don't pull from there, but they're using Chat GPT. I would tell them you still need to be on Google and they would be like, why? I be like, well, Google Chad GBT scrapes Google. Or like the other day, I was talking to a customer >> and there was like our customers are not on Tik Tok. I don't care that search search is blowing up on Tik Tok. I don't think that it's worth us being on Tik Tok. Our our competitors aren't. And I'm like, you just wait which LLM or search engines have data deals with Tik Tok. And if no one's on Tik Tok and you're on Tik Tok and it's part of the algorithm, it doesn't matter if you're get no buyers from Tik Tok, just having content on there and being on there. A lot of the other platforms where you do get customers will pull from Tik Tok. So, they're more likely to site you than the competitors who are not indexing on that one channel. and you are. So, a cool thing I like to do for brands like that is go to a tool like Uber Suggest, Semrush, type in that brand's domain, and see how many uh Tik Tok videos rank for the keywords that they rank for and that they want to rank for because a lot of brands are surprised if you think about the way that page one of Google looks now. There's this SER feature called what people are saying and it's full of Tik Tok and YouTube and Instagram and LinkedIn and they might not realize that for things they want to rank for keywords that they really care about, Google is putting these social networks right on page one. So they might not think that their audience is into these channels, but page one of Google is going to first of all reflect what users behavior is, right? So if it's on page one of Google, >> that's for a reason, right? But also, it's really surprising sometimes to these companies how often Tik Tok in some cases or LinkedIn or Instagram might have the same share of voice as that domain for their target keyword set. So, it's always really interesting to look at that and let the data tell the story. >> If you look at what Google's doing, there's a lot of different vernaculars, but a lot of marketers just believe like, oh yeah, that's just like Google suggest, which is the same thing as people also ask. And I'm like, uh, there's some differences and nuances with these areas. And if you look at what they're showcasing because people also ask is just mainly showcasing more terms that terms that or yeah, textbased terms that people are searching for. Um, and what you're talking about is actually pulling content from different platforms like social media. So even though your audience may not be on Tik Tok, if you pull if you create content for Tik Tok, Google pulls from there and Google has your ideal audience even though Tik Tok does it. Boom. You may get a leg up compared to your competition. >> Yep. Exactly. >> And then same with search. Like Instagram has 6.5 billion searches a day. Although most people are searching for friends. Uh but a portion of the people are looking for starting to become people looking for products, inspiration. Yeah. Um, and they're they're actually looking for content that can help them solve problems. Like I've done searches for other cool marketing tools for on Instagram for creating content for social, right? So even B2B searches, small percentage of searches, but they have so many. I do believe social search is going to be powerful once Meta figures out their act. And the reason I say that is meta search feature in Instagram and Facebook. It really does suck in my opinion. I they they've invested billions and billions in these data centers and stuff and buying these AI companies, but I believe their search functionality isn't that great compared to the competition. Yeah. And companies, we get head up for this all the time, are craving to rank when people search on social media. Like if you're Louis Vuitton, they want to make sure their handbag shows up anytime people are searching for handbags. And the content that you create for social, for search, in many cases is different than the content you would create for virality. Two very different things that a lot of companies just think, oh, you just create content, goes viral, you'll be at the top of all the search. It doesn't work that way. >> One final point though, there's two aspects of social search. There's people that are actively searching something, right? Which might be me. If I'm trying to pick a hotel or a vacation destination, I search Instagram all the time. But guess how many products I buy all the time that I didn't even think I wanted or needed. Never did a search, but I scan content on Instagram. I'm like, I need that >> all the time. So, there's this like passive search where it's like, oh, there's some like, what did I just buy the other day? Some like really cool probiotic. like it just, you know, I see it so many times and then I'm like, I need a probiotic and I'm just I'm going to buy this one because it keeps, you know, it's in front of me every day. So, it's a passive thing, too. >> We we did a survey on NP digital and it we had data on what percentage of your customers come from organic search, low singledigit percentile max. And then we, you know, we got data on what percentage of your customers first found you from social, organic social, and it was like uh around 20%. It's kind of crazy on the amount of people that discover on search, but it's so hard to attribute no matter how amazing of a data and analytics team that you have where >> it doesn't show up in the data and people take it for granted. Now, going back to content, Chad, if you were trying to create content for social search, not social views and impressions, but actually search like intentbased, how would you create content differently than just traditional social content? >> Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. What we would do first and foremost is take a look at the platform itself, right? There's keywords and information and data that we can pull directly from the platform and then build a strategy around that. So it's platform specific. It could be crossed over cross over with some of the SEO or search everywhere experience that we are we're driving, but you need to make sure that you're putting that social lens onto it. So whether it be a tool you're using to find out some of those trending topics or maybe something's trending on a hashtag that your brand can can latch on to all of that information you need to gather and audit and build specific content that then fills those gaps from your brand's perspective or that's filling that white space that is on that specific platform. So it's just putting that extra layer of the data that's coming from those platforms whether it be the platform itself or you know different tools that can pull from that. >> Yeah. And then the intent as well, right? Because when someone's searching, there's a very different intent than just uh scrolling through videos and watching. And a lot of times the videos that you create that are shorts don't necessarily have the intent that's around the topic someone would be searching for. Yes, >> I do think that Reddit is going to have a longer shelf life in visibility and influencing LLMs because it is the natural conversation that happens in that platform that people are typically searching in that in that way, shape and form on those channels and it's pulling from that. So, there are appropriate ways for brands to enter Reddit and not to do this what you would claim to spammy. Yes, I agree with you, but there are ways that brands can enter Reddit now as a branded profile to offer support, offer help in that platform. I like to call Reddit the social media channel that's not a real social media channel and it's the review site that's not a real review site from all these anonymous individuals, right? But there is a gold mine of content and information and conversations in there that brands can learn from but also can join the conversation and change that conversation. But going back to Reddit, whether it's Reddit or Core, any of those community-based sites, we have a chart that showcas how the Chad GBT started indexing or citing Reddit less frequently than they used to. Reddit stock also tanked from that as well. It's still one of the topictions even if it is >> Wikipedia a lot more. Yeah. But the real question is is this is just my take because it's more easily manipulatable than a lot of the other sources out there like a expert site talking about a company. I believe they'll still index on Reddit or Core or whatever, you know, community that is comm or whatever social network that is communitydriven that's uh they can get access to the data. I bet you they would index more on Facebook and Instagram if they would sell the data, but they don't sell the data to their competitors. I just think Chat GBT, just like we saw a drop. I believe in 2026 and beyond, it'll still be a source they site, but I believe over time they're going to site it less and less frequently because it's a site and a channel that is much more easier for marketers to manipulate. >> But I think Reddit's doing a decent job at making it harder to manipulate because we work with big brands and we have to figure out how do you get in there? How do you maintain a profile? boot and they're doing a decent job at kicking stuff out when they know it's spammy, when they know that you're not who you say you are. >> But I still see a lot of spam through Reddit. They're not catching >> all the nefarious characters. >> Yes. And when people pull up opinions on a specific industry, they're citing Reddit too heavily over industry publications. And the feedback on Reddit is really biased because it's the type of community that loves to hate. >> Yes, that's also true. It's not a community that loves to talk positively about a lot of stuff. They love going there to hate more than talk positively about something. >> But what's really cool is some of our clients at NPD have brand evangelists who love their products, love their brands, and they are willing to go into Reddit on behalf of those brands and speak positively about their experiences. And I'm not talking getting paid to do this or setting up a branded profile to pretend to be the brand. They're saying, \"We love your product so much, we'd be happy to go in and correct all of this misinformation.\" So, I think and that might be more of an exception than a rule, but I think I I'm hopeful that Reddit can remain a part of the way that people assess brands online through AI. Because personally, when I'm booking a hotel in Cabo and I want to know like how is the food, like I don't just trust what Google tells me. I'm like, I want to hear the raw, you know, real insights about what people thought and I kind of want the bad stuff from Reddit, you know, like people had a really bad experience. I kind of want to hear about it along with all the good stuff. So, I'm hopeful that we'll get it figured out and that it can be a trusted way to get like the real raw information that consumers might be looking for. But to your point though on the negative effect of Reddit and people going there for that a lot of the brands that we do support in Reddit or have started to talk to us about Reddit is is because of that negative sentiment that they're seeing being pulled in from Reddit and there is a lot of it right. So that that's you know going to your point people are following creators right people are following and trusting these individuals in their own social native platforms and they're deciding to buy things or make decisions because they trust these people. So it's an authority play right? >> They trust these unique creators that they've been following for so long and they build that relationship with them the creators with their audience. So I do think that that has a profound impact today on how people are searching whether or not they're going there first or as a part of their journey definitely a part of their journey but I do think more and more authoritative social creators in in certain spaces are getting a leg up right now with their audience. I think with UGC created content the big problem is a lot of people are sponsored by a brand so it's not as authentic. I'm not saying it's the majority. I don't have the data on what percentage, but the problem that you see with UGC generated content is it has to be done in a way where it's real and authentic. It's like Nikki earlier talked about the pillow and if she created a video on that pillow and how amazing it was and she no longer has pain. That's really useful. >> That's helpful. And it's like, oh, cool. Nikki was able to solve her back pain from this. And these social platforms know I'm looking at videos like that are chiropractic related, sleeping related, back pain related. So they're going to recommend new cond for me. And when you look at these search platforms, I hope they're pulling in the stuff that is authentic and real and not highly produced because with the laws at least in the US and in Europe, I don't know every single country, but majority of the larger countries from a GDP perspective, they have disclosure rules and AI can quickly detect if it is paid or not paid. And as long as they can eliminate that kind of stuff from search, I think that becomes really valuable because who doesn't want to see someone else that is similar going through a similar problem and describing how they feel? And to me, that's more valuable than just reading a textbased review on Amazon. >> Well, also data from Forbes and Earketer both show that brand loyalty is declining. And that's because you would you're going to sift through the 10 blue links on Google. Well, now it's an AI overview, right? Or this creator content, like you you have a couple of options to find what you're looking for. And people now trust creators, people that they're seeing on TikTok that they've never met before more than this brand being like, \"Hey, we've got the best pillow.\" You know, if they see it on a video, they're they're likely to trust it. Um, and that loyalty is declining. So, people are willing to try new products because somebody else said that it's great. And maybe there's, you know, some gray areas where it's like, is this sponsored or not? And you know, I think the best um the regulations in a lot of countries like help you believe that somebody will disclose if they're getting paid for it, but I'd rather passively see a few ads on TikTok and be like, you know what, I trust it. I'm going to try it. Then read 10 blog posts from probably an aggregator who's also paid to promote the pillow anyway. So, and then with brands that are with your statement, the brand loyalty declining and these creators are now coming in and taking some of that trust and actually influencing smart brands are actually starting to work with those creators too in different ways. Not just paying them to go and promote the product, but actually looping them into their marketing and strategy and content plays in a new in a new way that feels a little different. Yes, there's paid experiences with that still, but it's feeling and looking a little different than it did 10 years ago with the influencer play. Blog content is still helpful in today's search landscape because we know that to be present across all of these new surfaces where people are searching AI overviews, Google still has a lot of market share, right? Uh chatbt, you have to build up topical authority in the subject that you want to be an expert on. And there's a million questions that people are asking about how to solve their neck pain with pillows, right? And if you haven't written a bunch of blogs, you're not going to be a topical authority. You're probably not going to rank on Google and you're probably not going to get cited in these AI platforms. So blogs might be serving a little bit of a different purpose than they once were because we know that in a lot of cases like the clicks might not get there, but you can't be an authority in a subject if you have no content on your website. Yes, the community stuff that you might want to do on Reddit, the social stuff that you're doing are also important, but they don't replace the value of creating blog content in my opinion. >> Agree. Double down on that 100%. And brands search everywhere doesn't mean everywhere for every single brand. Everywhere depends on where your audience is going. So if your audience is overindexing in certain communities, in addition to the blog content experience that you just described, you do need to go into those communities. is you do need to figure out how to be a part of that if that's where your audience is. >> Yeah. I I don't see text going away. I see text being super important, but like you said, it's changed. People used to create text for visitors and then you try to get them to convert through popups, through links within the content, through sidebar ads or carousels at the bottom of the text, sending them to other pages or product. >> Those sounds familiar. >> Yes. I at this point I believe you need the text for traffic. some of those same old purposes, but it doesn't work as well as it used to from that aspect. Still does drive results though, >> but you also need it for topical authority, so that way you get the brand mentions and citations. >> And then you also need the video content, which they don't index as heavily on. And you need a combination of both, whether it's UGC or the companies creating it themselves, to get out there and get the mentions and really be the endall source for that topic. >> For sure. And I think you hear the words, you know, blog post and you think of like, you know, oh, some 12,000 word crap text based thing, but a good blog post today might be so much more than it was 5 or 10 years ago, right? We are doing >> custom data studies and pulling in proprietary data and creating that type of unique content. um if you're thinking about it in the right way and you're starting with the outcome in mind, which that type of content with proprietary data, unique data, insights that not everybody else is talking about, that's what allows you to go get brand mentions. It it can be the the stuff that you're pitching to the media. Um so it doesn't a blog post doesn't have to mean some boring thousandword thing that's been done a million times before. In fact, of course, it shouldn't today. You >> you nailed it. We have a chart on this. Facts, stats, and data. The number one reason that companies are being cited in AI overviews, uh, from the study that we ended up doing, it's writing a blog post isn't about length. It's about quality. Quality means a lot to a lot of different people. I know it's a really vague term, but it's about what can you showcase that's new and interesting that people haven't heard about or seen before, and how can you have a different perspective or lens on it that's related to what people are talking about or asking? and then you're more likely to get cited. >> Yeah, our favorite ways to create that quality content in that vein is yes, with data, but also with subject matter expertise, thought leaderships, and actually collaborating with other individuals in the space that our clients are in to create something new and unique as you're saying, and offering the audience that >> I don't think reputation is a new SEO. >> It's always been important. >> Yes. And I think it's elevated in this new state. It's not the SEO, but I think it's elevated to a point. >> What's crazy is that with AI models now, it is easy to gain them, right? >> We talked about this earlier. >> Every not everyone a lot of brands are creating a blog post on their website. Maybe they sell shoes and they create a blog that says, \"What are the test running shoes of 2025?\" just so happens ours is number one and it's working to get their shoe listed and mentioned within chat GBT and it's scary because people are are gaming it and a lot of users are just taking that at face value when they get that response back. So, I know we have a client in the financial services space and they've gotten a couple of customers who have said to them, \"Well, I asked ChatJBT a few different questions and every question I asked, your company name was Surface, so I figured you must be the best, right? I'm I'm ready to sign up.\" And they do financial portfolio management. These people are taking their millions of dollars and choosing this financial advisor, this wealth manager because Chachi PT surfaced their name for lots of surf like, you know, searches. So reputation is important and there's like this weird interweaving of like how visible are you if you're highly visible that could positively influence your reputation right there because the average searcher whether you're you know doing a prompt on chatbt or you're asking something to Google consumers trust that open AI and Google won't even show a brand unless they're reputable. Google historically has probably done a better job at this, right? Because they've invested a lot more in their algorithm and and uh filtering out spam over the years. Chat GPT, you know, maybe not quite there yet. So, >> yeah, the the blurry lines between like visibility and reputation are interesting in this AI era that we're in. >> Yeah. And I I believe you're going to end up seeing it where they look at it as you just need a decent enough reputation. You don't have to have the best reputation because a best reputation doesn't mean you're actually the best product or service. A company that's been around for 20 years may have a struggling reputation, but now there's a new product that comes into town just like Chad GPT came into town and Google and people like well if you look at the history more people have talked about Google than they have talked about Chad GPT over you know the last 20 years but in a short period of time Chad GBD is getting tons of press just like a new company could be getting a lot of reviews and mentions. So you look at the velocity. Should you end up uh positioning that old archaic company that's been around forever higher than the company that is just up and coming? And I think Google has been much better about this than I would say chat GPT because their algorithm is much more easy to manipulate and Google's way more fine-tuned. Um but you got to look at reputation as part of the equation. It really comes down to is a user satisfied in my opinion and that is the true signal. The question is can each platform get enough of that data >> and which platform does your audience trust to determine your reputation? Yes. Cuz we know that Google is just saturated and catchup is now too. But when you look at conversion rates by channel, a lot of brands are seeing very high conversion rates from AI search. I'm seeing over 8% from ChachiBT. That's wild. >> Social has a really high conversion rate for a lot of brands. I know for agencies, right? Like what you're putting out there on social is really shaping, you know, your reputation. >> Do you >> I think so. I I think that a lot of the work, a lot of the filming that we've done putting our thought leadership out there, people come to us and in the sales process or after they sign on, they say, \"Oh, yeah. I love all your content that I've been watching for a year, two years on LinkedIn, on TikTok, whatever.\" And I know I I was just at Brighton SEO in September, and I'm forgetting, was it Will Reynolds? I can't remember. One of the speakers that I watched who works for a competitor of ours of ours, they pulled up their social or their leads by percentage. I don't know for what time frame. And they were talking about how social is their top converting channel. And it's because these agencies are investing in genuine thought leadership like exactly what we're doing here today. And people trust it. They trust that company because of what they're seeing on social. And it's very different. They might not care what they find on a Google search. Um, but they they think, \"Hey, I've seen some really good content on LinkedIn, Tik Tok, where YouTube, wherever it might be. I trust this brand and I'm going to engage with them and I'm going to, you know, maybe get a pitch from them.\" So, reputations are shaped by different platforms today. And I think social is very, very high in terms of where people trust information from, right? Right. There's a lot of great genuine content on social and and Google and chat GBT alike have been spammed. There's also a lot of crap content on social that people probably don't realize is also spam. Um, but I think people are >> less loyal. Right? I said it earlier, Forbes and Earketer both say that brand loyalty is on the decline. And that's because people are like, \"Oh, I saw this person I've been following on TikTok for three years talk about this product and then I bought it.\" They just they trust them. I'm more skeptical when it comes to my purchase decision. And when I'm in that funnel or buying decision, I'm going to multiple channels, right? And I don't just take what I see at the top of a list as face value. I am skeptical. I like to double check. I like to ask my friends. And a lot of my friends in my age group, they're all going to TikTok for a lot of this. And so then they give me their advice because I'm not on TikTok a lot. But I get through them information that they found on Tik Tok about whatever that is and then that helps me with my decision and it's like you know what they say 20 plus touch points now before anyone makes a decision. I'm in that boat. So but I know that's not every audience. So when you're saying the reputation of your brand in the channel that it matters with your audience that makes sense. But then there's a lot of people that are going all over the place to kind of get a snapshot to then build whatever that picture of the reputation is of what they're seeing on those channels. But what's interesting about what you said is it blurs these lines between word of mouth and social because you're you're getting a recommendation from another human, but they might be regurgitating something they saw on Tik Tok about a product they never bought, a food they never ate, a restaurant they've never been to, but they saw it on Tik Tok and they trust it enough to regurgitate it to you even though they may not have had first person experience. >> Yeah. >> It's really interesting. >> It's just like my wife tells me, you know, we'll be at a restaurant like, \"Oh, you got to order this dessert. It's bomb. And she's like, \"You don't even really eat desserts.\" She's like, \"You tried it?\" And I'm like, \"No, I saw it on the internet.\" But it's the same way. But I agree that social is important. It does help build reputation. I think for us and our company, it's a little bit different. I know a lot of our customers have watched our content. And that's why I asked you, you know, do you really think so? I think for enterprise brands, which is where we've been going and shifting over the years, it's different, right? You're not going to get a RFP for a company that wants to spend $10 million with you in agency fees because of social content. >> I don't know because we had one of our larger brands on in the online tax space. They they came to us because they saw a webinar that we did on search everywhere optimization. Now I don't know if you consider webinar social, right? It could be its own it its own group but content people are seeing online video content um that is getting us big brands >> webinars are I consider social more like the short form videos >> okay yeah webinars >> so on that short form video that very same company you're discussing when we were in the pitch process now I'm not saying the person who is making the decision saw the social video and called us to have a pitch but the individuals who are now going to help make that decision for the company who working with us or not mentioned that they were watching our short form videos on social and they really liked it and it one of the the PC's was from the social team so that that tracks but then there was a couple others who were agreeing with that as well not from webinar content but like our actual social media video content so I I I do believe you have to be everywhere >> and that's why I've been creating content for years but I'll give you a data point all right so the search landscape's changed when we used to focus more on getting website traffic. You know, we were ranked number one for terms like digital marketing, online marketing. We used to so focus on it. Do you know how much revenue we were generating from those terms? Anyone you want to take a guess? >> No idea. >> Probably not much based on the look of your face. >> Yeah, not much at all. Cuz I've gotten people being like, where are your rankings for those key terms? Didn't drive much revenue. >> And on the flip side, I used to get more social engagement when I used to create content that was mass audience. Mhm. >> And if you look at the content now that we create as a company, it's more narrowed down to specific verticals and problems that our ideal customers are facing. It gets way less views and engagement. I still believe social is important. I just have a different lens that I have before in which the key to building that reputation and to doing well and having driving you customers is to do content creation for your ideal customer profile, your ideal ICP and get very very granular. It can't just be I'm looking for a company that is DTOC. I think that's too broad, >> right? Like this week the content was focused around franchises with ideally 50 to 100 plus locations. I believe most marketers agree that you can't have silos to really do well because you need all the information sharing and a lot of the channels rely on different uh like AI platforms rely on Reddit which is social, Google relies on video content, YouTube, right? You need digital PR to do well and the list goes on and on. And if you want to do well in chat GBT, they scrape Google whether people like it or not. Hence, Google made a change where you no longer scrape a 100red listings per scrape. You'll scrape uh 10 listings per scrape, which cost Chad GBT a lot more money. But so, everyone knows that, right? And we get that. But the question is is uh let's redefine it. How would you create your marketing department knowing that you can't really have silos? Because it's unrealistic to have one team that does everything. Correct. I think that you need to have a different type of working relationship with those teams within an organization where the silos are more specific and maybe siloed, right? Like more siloed than others. I've seen it work at enterprise. >> Let's break down an example. So, what would you do with social, for example? Would that just be one silo? Would you have a silo just for Tik Tok, one for long form video, one for each platform? Like, what would you do? >> Oh my goodness. I mean, I guess it would it just depends on the company first and foremost and then figure out where you prioritize what channels you need, but I don't think it needs to be social siloed by the channel. I think it can be social media organic, right? And then they all collaborate in one way or another, however they are, but that team needs to collaborate with the other specific teams. I'm not saying like sparse out specific subdivisions under each one of those channels. >> So, you're still saying paid is a department, social is a department. All right. So then we are we we run a similar model internally at our own agency. You're in content, you're in SEO. >> How do you guys communicate >> for example of how a company should ideally communicate and break down silos? Cuz although we have different departments, social, content, paid, etc. We don't have the silo issue internally cuz we have a team member on each one of those channels that are leading on that on that account, right? So our team from an SEO content DBRR perspective are always collaborating. >> Yeah. I think the key that a lot of businesses are missing is you have to force collaboration. And what I mean by that is at a lot we work with a lot of big enterprises right and this group is not talking to this group. It could be social and SEO are not talking. You know paid and SEO pretend like they're talking but half the time they're really not getting anything done. You as a leader, as a CMO, you have to force collaboration between all of these groups. If it were me, I would have a standing meeting with the sole purpose to be sharing ideas, talking about what you're doing, what's working, what's not working, and force that ongoing communication and collaboration because so often we see so many opportunities that we could help our clients capitalize on if those groups talked. And you know what we hear all the time? Well, we don't really work with that team or we've tried to work with that team and it's >> or they have different goals >> or different incentives. That's another problem. >> Goals and incentives. And I think one thing that not many people are talking about right now is that paid and SEO for whatever reason it seems to be so challenging to get these departments to truly collaborate. >> You talk about it all the time. Oh, you could maximize your efficiency on paid if you talk about SEO and SEO could be learning from paid. And it's it's harder than it sounds, right? Which is why it doesn't happen a lot. But with where paid is headed, which is Pmax and AIAX are essentially these are AI generated campaigns. This is what Google is pushing big time. And a lot of our clients are scared to get into it because it's relinquishing control. >> That's like a black box, >> right? But it's where things are headed. And the big thing with this is your SEO team and your paid team have to collaborate and communicate. Two reasons. One, AI overviews are changing a lot about paid at search, right? If an AI overview appears, your expected click-through rate on paid goes down. When your expected click-through rate goes down, your CPCs go up because your quality scores go down. And everybody on paid is spending more money because of AI overviews. And your SEO team is every day we are looking at what queries are populating AI overviews. Are we ranking? Are we not ranking? What are the themes of these AI overviews? How can we adjust our content to get in there? And your SEO team has all this gold mine of information that should be passed on to your paid team. But if you are not forcing them to sit in a room virtually or physically and talk every single week about what they're seeing, guarantee they're not actually going to do anything with that data. But that's only point number one. Point number two is with where Pmax and AI Max are headed. These are AI crawlers, right? Google's paid bot is going to assess your website content. They're going to look at your headings, your body content, your FAQs, the alt tags of your images, and they are going to decide what to pull in to these ads. That, by the way, they're also deciding where you show up. Is it YouTube? Is it display? Is it search? If your content is not optimized, if it's not well structured, if you're not uh optimizing for semantic search, you will not get the ROI from these paid campaign types in the future once everybody gets on to these campaign types, which that's where things are headed. So, there's a huge opportunity now to get your SEO and your paid teams in the same room and talking because your ad dollars are going to be at stake if you don't do this sooner than later. >> No. And companies are spending a lot more money on things like branded queries when it comes to bidding. And it's just like they're not communicating. And I know we do it where it's like if you're ranking number one, we just turn off the bidding. If your competitor starts bidding, we instantly start turning back on the bidding. So then that way you're not burning dollars. Um but they're not communicating. And I'm seeing the same thing with SEO. It's easier to get conversion data from paid than it is from SEO. And I don't know why SEOs don't walk over to their paid or data analytics team and be like, \"Can I have the conversion data for the best terms?\" All right, cool guys. This is what we're going to start focusing on because this is what's driving revenue. Forget the traffic angle. And I rarely ever see that, no matter what size organization. And when I say what size organization, I very rarely talk to the companies that are doing like 20, 30, 50 million in revenue. They tend to be at least nine figure companies. some, you know, uh, many of them are multi-billion dollar organizations, but they just don't talk. And I think you're right, you got to force it. And like what you're saying, you got to put someone in whose job is to work in the different departments and bring and >> them together and just force collaboration. Have any of you guys use some of these new AI browsers? Well, I have not because I don't have a Mac, but also on a company computer at NPD, I don't think you're allowed to because these browsers are not there yet in terms of security, what I've heard. So, >> beware. Use your personal machine. Don't jeopardize your company's data. >> I I've tested uh one of them out >> and >> Atlas or what's the other one? Comet. >> Atlas. I haven't comet yet. Um, and I would say it's it's okay. But here's the problem I have with these AI browsers. Chrome just has everything. >> And when I mean that it has everything, it has like your passwords and history and you know it's secure. Oh, you got hide the word all the extensions. >> I think it's a very hard transition to get people to switch browsers. It's easier to get them to switch a search engine. Yes. >> than it is to get them to switch a browser. It's like telling someone to switch a email client like to go from Gmail to Outlook or Outlook to Gmail. That is a very hard ask. >> Or Slack to Teams. >> Very hard ask. But and and I think a browser is in that camp. >> Yeah. >> I don't think Open AI and Perplexity and anyone else who wants to get into this space is going to do well with the browser game. we already have existing browsers and unless you do something just genuinely new and crazy. I don't see people switching and Google's going to integrate all the AI stuff into browsers and then eventually chat GBT will make it where you can just integrate into Chrome. >> Right. >> Right. Browsers will impact what people are doing because you can get what you're looking for wherever without ever having to go to a website and they can just pull. I just think it's surfacing information in a way like Alexa surfaces information or Siri does or your car can depending on the car that you have. It's just surfacing information wherever you want. >> And you always have your skeptics, too. And I think the number of hacking, you know, type situations uh that happen. And I forget if it was Comet or um Atlas that got hacked or jailbroken within 24 hour or 48 hours. And I think you know people out there have proven both perplex perplexities comet and open AAI's Atlas are like not secure and the minute that this gets you know publicized because I feel like it's actually not as widely known maybe people just aren't >> No, I I saw that and it's the big thing is would you log into your bank account using one of those adverts? >> Definitely not. So how am I going to get anything done if I don't trust it to make purchases correct on my behalf? And you're always going to have that percent of the population that is skeptical. You're going to have the people that are like, I'm not going to Venmo you. I'm not putting my bank information somewhere all the way to the people that are just like healthfully skeptical. And because of that, like the adoption will probably be slow for a very long time. Well, even with these AI browsers, I don't think it's going to affect visibility as negative as most people think. Just like if you look at majority of the time and attention right now, it's not spent from people reading textbased articles. It's people just scrolling on their phone and looking at social content. Yet, we're still able to figure out visibility. Just like people like, \"Oh, SEO traffic's dying down.\" Well, we have customers, a lot of customers where their total traffic is down, but because these new channels bring in a lot of conversions at a higher rate, their total revenue is growing for these organizations. I just think marketers have to shift. >> Does it mean people won't ever go to your website again? No, I don't believe that. I think people still go to websites. Well, you know, if you have a 100 people going to your website right now, may it decrease in the future? Sure. But you just have to adapt. And I think that's the great thing about being marketers in this world. I think it's actually gotten harder for us to do our jobs, but at the same time, it's made us more in demand for our customers. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. And I think you're going to have to market to manin machine, right? You're going to have a part of your marketing where you are marketing to real people that you know have real interests and then you're going to be marketing to these machines that just are trying to figure out what your website does and you know complete an action on behalf of people and again we're not there right now and it's going to take a while but it's something worth thinking about in the future. >> But check this out. You guys have already been marketing to man and machines. >> True. >> Okay. So people talk about like agents. Oh you got to have an agent market to agent. We've been marketing whether it's our app store company or division or through SEO or social media. We market to algorithms to showcase our client stuff and then a human interacts with it. What's the difference from then uh AI agent or some machine pulling from what we already marketed to that's ranking at the top because we did it. >> Well, one difference will be the importance of data feeds, right? Like the way that you maintain your data feed is all for machines. your users are never going to see something like that. So, >> and I think a lot of brands will need to like maximize, you know, filling out every part of their data feed in the future. Again, we're not there. >> No, you have to be more thorough because the machine will look at everything while the human will just want the key takeaways. >> Yeah. But at the same time from a marketing perspective we've adapted and already shifted to marketing to machines. Whether it's a human at the end that looks at the information or another machine will continually adapt. >> Yep. >> Marketing is similar but it continually evolves and I think that doesn't change.
