  What's really happening with AI agents and knowledge work? The common story is that coding tools are for coders — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on why Claude Cowork matters more than the feature list suggests:

   • Why file system agents beat browser agents for high-stakes work
   • How the anti-slop architecture shifts cognitive load upstream
   • What task queues replacing chat means for AI interaction
   • Why Anthropic shipped this in 10 days using their own tool

  Developers were using Claude Code to organize expense receipts. That signal — plus the holiday explosion of non-technical users building with terminal tools — told Anthropic they were sitting on the first truly general purpose agent. Cowork is that capability wrapped in an interface anyone can use.

  For knowledge workers, this is the moment file-based AI work becomes accessible — but verification and intent formulation become the scarce skills.
