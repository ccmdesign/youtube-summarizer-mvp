  "fullText": "Cursor CEO Michael Trule let GPT 5.2 run for a week straight in January of 2026. No human touched the keyboard, and when it finished, the AI had generated 3 million lines of Rust code and built a functional browser rendering engine from scratch. HTML parser, CSS, Cascade, all of it. This experiment forced a question that every organization is going to have to answer in 2026. Is your AI shaped like a colleague or is it shaped like a tool? The distinction determines how you work, what you can accomplish, and who on your team can use AI effectively. Claude Code and OpenAI's codecs represent two distinct philosophies of human AI collaboration, and choosing between them is not about benchmarks. It's about deciding what you believe AI should be and being honest about what kind of AI you're actually ready to use. Claude Code launched in February 2025 as Enthropic's command line agentic coding tool and it immediately changed how developers thought about AI assisted programming. Unlike traditional autocomplete assistants, Claude Code operates at what Anthropic calls an active collaborator. It can search, it can read code, it can edit files, it can write and run tests, it can commit and push to GitHub. Every step of the way, it's working with you. The key phrase is it keeps you in the loop. So Claude code is built around the idea of a fast feedback cycle. You assign a task and Claude runs with it. A few minutes later, it comes back with results. It asks clarifying questions or explains where it got stuck and then you iterate. This rhythm feels familiar to anyone who has managed a capable direct report. You delegate something, they come back with questions, they come back with a draft, you provide direction, they refine. The back and forth is not a bug. It's intentional. It's design. Anthropic has explicitly stated that Claude is a different philosophy from every other reasoning model on the market and they deliver on it with the way they've put Claude into the harness here. The company emphasizes that Claude code completed tasks in early testing that would normally take 45 plus minutes of manual work. And guys, that was back in 2025. And we have seen since as future versions of claude have come out how long that number has stretched. It's into 7 hours, 8 hours, it's into a full day of work now. Codeex emerged from a different tradition entirely. OpenAI released it as a cloud-based software engineering agent powered by Codeex, which is a version of their reasoning model optimized specifically for autonomous software engineering. So when Claude code emphasized dialogue and iteration and has carried that through more recently into the co-work UI, Codeex has emphasized delegation and completion of work, especially technical work. You can assign it tasks through a prompt or a spec, and it will navigate your repository, edit files, run commands, and execute tests without any intermediate action whatsoever. The product documentation describes it as delegating tasks end to end, and that is correct. That architectural difference matters. Codeex runs in isolated sandbox environments in the cloud where it can work for extended periods on very complicated tasks. And during internal testing, OpenAI has reported the ability to make it work for hours and hours, a couple of days. We've seen this result at the top of the video where I talked about how they got chat GPT 5.2 to work for a week straight. It goes on long, long tasks. This is not a conversational assistant that happens to write code. It's something closer to a shift worker that you spin up in the cloud and point it a to understand why this distinction between claude code and codeex matters so much for the future of work. Consider how manufacturing works. A skilled machinist can sit at a lathe and shape metal through direct manipulation and adjust their approach based on how the material responds. This is an intimate iterative work and a crafts person and the tool are in dialogue and a good machinist can get to incredible tolerances this way. A CNC machine works differently. You program it with precise instructions, the exact coordinates, the feed rates, etc., and then you step back. The machine executes those instructions with superhuman precision and cuts complex geometries that would be impossible to achieve by hand. But here's the critical difference. If your program is wrong, the machine will faithfully execute your wrong program. It won't ask clarifying questions. It won't notice that something is off. It will just produce what you specify, whether that's precision aerospace components or piles of scrap. Codeex is CNC shaped. It's designed for developers who can define tasks precisely, who know exactly what they want, and who can specify correct intent upfront. When you give Codeex a well-formed spec, it will execute that spec with remarkable fidelity over extended periods. The Cursor experiment demonstrated this at scale. They made thousands of commits the codeex agents over the course of the week and they built an entire complex system without human steering. Claude code is more machinist shaped. It's designed for developers who want to think alongside their tools, who expect to evolve their intent through the process of building, who value the ability to catch mistakes early and to a just course. The tool surfaces reasoning and ask questions where it's uncertain and treats development as a conversation as much as a specification. And so a pattern has started to emerge anecdotally in the developer community over the past several weeks and months that has illuminated this distinction. Very senior engineers, people with decades of experience in deep architectural knowledge. I have heard multiple engineers reporting that codeex delivers substantially higher productivity than cloud code for their workflows because their their to the point where their PR request output doubles after switching. This makes complete sense once you understand the CNC metaphor. Senior engineers have the institutional knowledge required to define precise specs. They know what correct looks like technically. They have debugged enough systems to anticipate edge cases and specify requirements. They can write the kind of detailed instructions that a CNC machine needs to produce good outputs. Kurser's research findings illuminate the specific model behaviors that create this advantage. When comparing GPT 5.2 two against Opus 4.5 on extended autonomous tasks. They find that 5.2 follows instructions, maintains focus, avoids drift, and implements things completely. By contrast, Opus tends to stop earlier, take shortcuts when convenient, and will yield back control quickly to the user. For a senior engineer who's done the hard work of specking out the entire product, the constant yielding of control is an inefficiency. For someone still figuring out what they want, though, it's not. It's a lifeline. And so the cursor team has discovered a counterintuitive result. GPT 5.2 is a better planner even than GPT 5.1 codecs, the model specifically trained for coding. And this suggests that raw reasoning capability matters more than narrow training for very long horizon autonomous work. The ability to maintain coherent plans over very extended periods, to adapt when approaches fail, and to keep working toward distant goals without losing focus. Those are generalized cognitive abilities, right? And they turn out to be more important than specialized coding knowledge. When you're asking an AI to work independently for hours or days. So when a developer with this kind of background sends codecs off to implement a feature, they're not sending it into the unknown. They're providing a very clear spec that draws on years of accumulated wisdom about what works and what does not. And the result is that codecs can run for hours or days and when it comes back the work is done correctly because the spec was correct. An engineer has described his workflow. When I send codeex to do a task, I can switch my focus off entirely. I can open up Figma to do design work. I can write my newsletter or open another terminal and get codeex going on some server work while the first terminal is chugging along on the client side. In other words, it is entirely autonomous. This is the CNC advantage, right? If you have the expertise to program the machine, you get compound leverage. The AI works while you work on something else. But the same pattern makes codeex powerful for senior engineers and very frustrating for everyone else. If you cannot define tasks with technical precision, if you're not sure what right looks like, if you're still developing intuitions about architecture, codeex becomes a liability in places. Curser's own experiments revealed this dynamic when they tested different models on longrunning autonomous tasks. They ran into exactly that issue. For a junior or mid-level developer, the Claude code workflow provides something that you can't get anywhere else. Scaffolding for learning. When Claude explains its reasoning and asks whether a particular approach makes sense, it's potential issues. It's effectively teaching you at the same time as it's building. The conversation itself has value beyond the code. it produces. And Anthropic's internal research supports this. A survey of 130 some Anthropic engineers found that while they use clawed code frequently, more than half said they can fully delegate only about a fifth of their work to the tool. This is a reflection in my mind of how the tool is designed more than anything else. Engineers work actively and iteratively with Claude, validating outputs rather than just accepting them. So let's step back. Underneath these product differences, there is a philosophical disagreement about the nature of work and the role of AI within it. OpenAI's approach assumes that if you can instruct an AI correctly and the AI can execute correctly, the human in the middle is overhead. It should be minimized. The ideal workflow is spec followed by execution. This philosophy has a certain elegance. It's the vision behind the cursor browser experiment. And as AI capabilities improve, this approach does scale. You can spin up more agents, run them for longer, and accomplish more without proportionally increasing your human involvement. The scaling dynamics are worth considering carefully. Curser's multi-agent experiment used a hierarchical structure where planners decompose tasks, workers then execute implementations, and reviewers check quality. This really mirrors the organizational design of a human software company with roles analogous to PMs and architects and programmers. And so the team was able to achieve something remarkable. Effectively hundreds of agents collaborating on the same codebase with minimal code conflicts. And this suggests that AI can develop the kind of collaborative understanding that human teams can take a long time to build. But but before you hear doom, the browser experiment has revealed limits. This is not a fully functioning browser that is going to take over the world tomorrow. And this is a very expensive experiment. The experiment likely consumed at least from outside estimates something like three billion tokens. And so as token costs evolve, we are going to have to look at where it makes sense to apply that kind of high autonomy activity. What level of work counts is done? Does an alpha version of a browser is that worth it in a week and then we put the humans on it? Those are the kinds of questions we're going to have to answer in 2026. Cursor just shows us that it's possible. Anthropics approach assumes something different. That the process of building software involves evolving intent. That requirements change as you understand problems. That the most valuable work happens at the dialogue between human judgment and AI capability. And this philosophy treats the back and forth not as a friction that you eliminate but as the mechanism through which good software gets made. Look, I'll be very frank. I think codeex is the better answer when you can define technical correctness for a longunning task up front. It gets you farther. If you know what write looks like, you can specify it and the success criteria are there and codecs will just run and run and run and run and it can often outperform cla code dramatically. Claude code is the better answer when intent needs to evolve through work. If you're figuring out what you want as you build, if requirements are ambiguous, as it is so often in the rest of knowledge work, not in coding, which is why we see co-work, if you need to discover correctness rather than specify it, Claude's iterative dialogue is not a limitation, but the entire point, and this describes so much junior technical work and nearly all of non-technical knowledge work right now. The mistake is treating this as a preference, as apples versus Windows or a matter of style. It it's none of those things. It is a question of matching the tool to the actual situation that you're in. The distinction between toolshaped and colleague shaped AI extends beyond the terminal into how we're going to interact with AI agents more broadly. Anthropic's recent launch of Claude co-work essentially cla wrapped in a graphical user interface suggests one vision of the future. The product operates as a desktop application that can read and edit and organize files right on your machine. It's designed around that human in the loop requirement that anthropic likes. Again, that iteriveness is there. It is colleague-shaped AI taken to its logical conclusion. People, it's an inbox model where you assign tasks, receive results, provide feedback, and iterate across multiple threads. The interface metaphor is Slack or it's email. Ongoing conversations with an intelligent entity that requires your input and values your judgment. Tool-shaped AI will have a different interface. If codec style products become the norm, the user interface might look more like a project management dashboard. You define the specs, you assign the agents, you monitor progress, and you review outputs. The metaphor is not conversational. I believe both interfaces will exist. The question is which one matches how you think about work and what kind of work you and your team is doing. And here is the uncomfortable truth embedded in all of this. Most of us don't know which kind of AI we're ready to use. And most of us overestimate our ability to specify precise intent. When you give Claude code a vague instruction and it asks clarifying questions, it might feel frustrating and you might think you can give Codex the same vague instruction and it will execute autonomously. I doubt it. The feedback loop that makes clawed code feel slower is the mechanism that allows you to sharpen your intent. The developers who succeed with codecs tend to be very self-aware about their limitations. They know what they know. They specify what they want and they're honest about when they don't have enough clarity to delegate. They've developed the skill of writing highquality specs and translating that expertise and instructions an autonomous agent can execute. And the developers who struggle with codeex often don't even realize they're struggling. They'll send off a task that seemed well specified, but it will return something incomplete and incorrect. And by the time they discover the issues, they've built on top of broken foundations. Perhaps the most significant implication in all of this is around non-technical work. Right now, the colleague versus tool debate is playing out primarily for software developers because code is where all of this has started. But the same dynamic will shape AI adoption across every single knowledge work domain. Consider the task of producing a 100page business proposal. With colleague shaped AI, you might work through the document iteratively, drafting sections, getting feedback, refining arguments, etc. The AI ends up being a thinking partner through the process. With tool-shaped AI, you would need to write a comprehensive specification upfront that describes exactly what the doc should contain, how it should be structured, what arguments it should make, and what evidence it should cite. Then you'd submit that spec and receive a finished document hours later. Few non-technical professionals have the skills to write the kind of spec that would produce a good 100page doc on a first pass. They don't know what they want until they see what's possible. The intent evolves through the process of creation. For these people, colleague shaped AI will be essential at least until they develop the spec skills that come naturally to senior software engineers. But for people who can specify complex non-technical work precisely, perhaps for experienced consultants or very senior strategists, tool-shaped AI might unlock the same kind of productivity gains that senior engineers are finding with codeex today. They could define a complex analysis and delegate it to an autonomous agent and receive finished work product without having to shepherd the process. So the question of what highquality spec looks like for non-technical work is almost entirely unexplored. It is one of the big questions of 2026. We have very little idea what the equivalent of a great technical spec looks like for a strategy doc or for a market analysis or creative content. That is one of the most exciting things about the year ahead. The colleague versus tool question is not going to go away. If anything, it will become more acute as AI capabilities continue to improve in both directions. Both approaches will get more powerful and benefits and risks for each approach are going to intensify. And so for individuals, for all of us, the immediate task is to be honest, right? Do you have the domain expertise to write real spec? Can you define correct outcomes before you start building? Be honest with yourself. If yes, then a tool-shaped AI offers extraordinary leverage. If no, colleague shaped AI offers something equally valuable. A thinking partner that helps you develop clarity through dialogue and catches your mistakes early and supports your growth. For organizations, this is a more complex question. You probably have people on both sides. You have junior experts who can leverage autonomous agents and junior contributors who need iterative collaboration. And you probably have some senior folks who just need to go. The meta question, the one that will determine competitive advantage over the next few years, is how quickly you can develop highquality intent specification skills across your org so that you can take advantage of both sides, including advanced tool-shaped AI. Company that figures out what high-grade intent looks like, those companies are going to thrive. Those companies are going to be able to access a different order of AI leverage than companies still treating AI as a conversational partner. But don't mistake capability for readiness. There are serious questions about how even highly autonomous work is going to be deeply integrated into the rest of our production workflows. The cursor browser experiment is a good example. You got to a functional alpha. It is a tremendous achievement. Simon Willis had private had publicly projected this to be a 2029 task. We did it in 2026. Fantastic. But if this were real software, the journey to production would just be beginning and we would have a whole separate conversation around how you take highly autonomous work that was done well and incorporate it into production software. So the question for 2026 is not which AI is better in the abstract. That question doesn't make sense. Codeex is better when you can define correctness for highly complex technical tasks. Claude code is better when you need an iterative conversation to develop intent. And the question I have for you is whether you're honest enough with yourself about which situation you're in to pick the right tool for you.",
