  title: "How to Build a Product that Hits PMF on Day 1 | Granola, Christopher Pedregal"
  description: "Meet Christopher Pedregal, the Co-founder and CEO of Granola.


    Granola is an AI note taking service that is being called \"one of the most beloved AI products in Silicon Valley.\" But how do you build something that users are truly obsessed with?


    Christopher has a unique track record. Before Granola, he left Google to build a startup called Socratic. After Socratic was acquired by Google, he eventually left the tech giant a second time to build Granola AI.


    If you are building a product, especially an AI product, Christopher’s practical tips on how to talk to users will be very helpful. He built Granola as a product that had Product-Market Fit from Day 1 by mastering the art of user interviews. Do you want to know how to talk to users? This is the video for you.

## Key Takeaways

Granola's co-founder shares his philosophy for building products that users love from day one, centered on deep user understanding and disciplined development cycles.

- **Systematize User Feedback**: Make talking to users frictionless (e.g., Granola holds standing interviews 4 days/week) to build intuition and avoid long feedback delays that kill learning.

- **Distinguish Explore vs. Exploit Phases**: First, explore wildly to find the right product 'shape' (Granola cut 50% pre-launch); then exploit by polishing that core, as polishing the wrong shape is wasted effort.

- **Build Products with 'Soul'**: Create a coherent, consistent product experience that feels like it comes from a single set of values, avoiding the disconnect that reveals a company's internal structure.

- **Use Conservative Metrics & Skeptical Inquiry**: Define 'active user' strictly (e.g., Granola requires a new 5+ minute meeting) and ignore positive feedback in interviews, focusing on observing behavior and probing negatives to uncover true needs.

## Summary

Christopher Pedregal, co-founder and CEO of the AI meeting notepad Granola, shares the framework that led his company to achieve product-market fit on its launch day—though he admits it took six months to recognize that success. His core philosophy rejects building based on a prioritized list of user requests, advocating instead for a deep, intuitive understanding of user context developed through relentless, low-friction contact.

**The Lifeblood: Systematized User Feedback**
Pedregal stresses that talking to users must be effortless and embedded in company rhythm. At Granola, this means standing user interviews four days a week that any employee can join. He learned this at his previous company, Socratic, where bringing high school students into the office (even just to do homework) dramatically accelerated product improvement. The goal is to shorten feedback cycles drastically; if it takes a month to get feedback, "it's almost not worth doing" because you forget the original reasoning. The key insight is that you don't need 10 people to identify a problem—if one user's confusion is immediately understandable, fix it and move to the next learning.

**The Two-Phase Build Process: Explore, Then Exploit**
A major advantage for Granola was not launching for a year. This allowed a pure **explore phase**—adding features and radically changing the product to find its essential 'shape.' Once identified, they cut 50% of what they'd built. After finding the shape, they entered the **exploit phase**, focused entirely on polishing that core. The critical, difficult judgment is knowing when to switch from exploration to exploitation; launching is often the catalyst for this realization.

**Building Intuition and Products with 'Soul'**
The aim is to build a shared intuition about the user—holding hundreds of users in your head to predict reactions. This leads to products with **'soul'**—a coherent, consistent experience that feels like it comes from a unified set of values, not a disconnected org chart. This requires balancing user input with a strong product vision; you listen to understand context, but use your own intuition to decide what to build.

**Rigorous Metrics and Skeptical Inquiry**
To avoid self-delusion, Granola uses extremely conservative metrics (e.g., only counting a user if they start a new meeting with 5+ minutes of transcription). In interviews, they categorically ignore positive feedback and aggressively probe negative reactions and observed behaviors, never asking "Would you use this?" This harsh realism is essential for recognizing true PMF, which Pedregal notes is notoriously hard to see in the moment, even for companies like early Facebook.

## Context

This talk is crucial for product managers, founders, and developers building in today's competitive SaaS and AI landscape, where achieving rapid product-market fit is existential. It counters common agile dogma by emphasizing that user feedback is not about building a feature list, but about developing deep intuition. The 'explore/exploit' framework and focus on 'product soul' are particularly relevant as AI features risk becoming generic commodities; differentiation comes from a uniquely coherent user experience rooted in authentic user understanding.
