  What's really happening with AI and how we work? The common story is that AI tools are making us more productive — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on why most work habits are now optimizing for the wrong thing:

   • Why execution capacity is no longer the scarce resource
   • How the bottleneck shifted to clarity, ambition, and distribution
   • What eight habits are actively costing you in an AI-native world
   • Why the meeting to discuss a feature now takes longer than building it

  Anthropic shipped Cowork in 10 days with four people. Meanwhile, somewhere a leader is asking for a 30-day implementation roadmap. The chaos you're feeling is not random — it's the gap between where the bottleneck moved and the habits you still have.

  For professionals navigating this shift, the opportunity is significant — but only if you stop protecting execution and start doing it.
