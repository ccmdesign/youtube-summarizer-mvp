  "fullText": "The one constant right now is chaos. I hear it over and over again from folks. The rate of change, the sheer unpredictable chaos of AI is very difficult to tell what's up and what's down. So, in this video, I want to simplify it. I want to zero in on some of the underlying drivers that are shifting what truly AI native working looks like. Why most of our work habits are now optimizing for the incorrect thing. And I want to give you some specific habits, eight of them in fact, that you can break that help you start working in a more AI native way. But first, I want to start with two scenes from the last month. Number one, enthropic shipping co-work a full product feature. It was built in 10 days with just four people. It was written entirely in claude code. And claude code, mind you, is an entire product that is less than a year old. And so these folks have not had years working AI natively to do this. The anthropic team is evolving as they go. Meanwhile, scene two at your company and many companies I've worked at in the past, there's a conference room where I guarantee you a leader is asking for a 30-day implementation roadmap or a three-month implementation roadmap for their AI strategy with phases and milestones and resource allocation and a plan to protect capacity. Listen, execution capacity isn't scarce anymore. 10 days, four people, and they're shipping 60 to 100 releases daily. Execution capacity is not the problem. When we build our AI strategies, we're frequently asking for help or asking for guidance on the thing that is no longer scarce and no longer requires efficiency. We have spent so much of our business lives assuming that execution capacity is scarce. Anthropic and many other organizations now are showing that it's not scarce anymore. And yet every organization, all of our individual work habits, anyone who's had a career more than three, four years in the industry, it's all built around the implicit answer to one question. What's expensive here? And the answer has been execution. For most of our careers, building things required scarce hours from scarce people with scarce skills. Finding really good engineers was really hard. Training them took a long time, maybe years. Every hour of their time was precious. And so we evolved elaborate rituals to protect that capacity. Planning processes, approval gates, specs, PRDs, meetings to align before anybody built. All of it was designed to protect the precious engineering execution time so it wouldn't be wasted on the wrong problems. And that made sense. When the meeting to discuss a feature takes much less time than the time to build it, you definitely want to hold the meeting so you get it right. When gathering the requirements costs much less time than writing the code, you want to gather the requirements first. When rework is really expensive, you want to plan really meticulously so you avoid rework. Now I know and you know that there have been movements in software to make this easier. Agile comes to mind. But even then, engineering work remained expensive and agile was a response to the idea that you had to optimize engineering work over time to deliver value. AI has inverted the entire cost ratio and changed the way we think. We're no longer in a world where we argue about waterfall versus agile. We're in a world where we're talking about a different kind of work entirely. Agile never imagined a world where everybody commits code in the organization. Curser, the AI code editor, they went from a million dollars to $500 million in annual revenue faster than any SAS company in history. And they're not done yet. They are launching Cursor for designers. And they're not launching it as a separate product. They're just relentlessly shipping features inside Cursor that make it easier and easier and easier for other job families to use that tool. What used to be an impossible product expansion is now another day at cursor. What used to be a new feature like claude co-work that took months to plan and ship is now 10 days for four people. Coinbase engineers report that single people are now refactoring, upgrading or building new code bases in days. Same story. So in that world, the meeting to discuss a feature now takes longer than building the feature. The PRD can take longer than the prototype. The planning process can take longer than shipping three version and seeing which ones work. The bottleneck has moved, but our work habits are still stuck in the way we've worked most of our careers. There's a manufacturing principle that explains a lot of what's happening here. When you eliminate a bottleneck in a manufacturing system, the bottleneck doesn't actually disappear. It moves somewhere else downstream in the system. you see the new crunch point in the system. Resistance is never destroyed, it's relocated. And so when you gain efficiency in one place, you see new constraints. That's what's happening now. And so for decades, the constraint in knowledge work was execution. Now that AI has largely removed that constraint, the bottleneck has shifted. It hasn't disappeared. A lot of people will tell you it's disappeared. It's not disappeared. is shifted to clarity, to ambition, to distribution, and to relationships. And we're still running around using work habits that are designed to protect execution capacity. We are optimizing for the old work constraint while the new one is compounding. So, let's explore where that bottleneck went. Clarity. Do you actually know what's worth building? That is now a billion-dollar question. You can now build faster than you can think. Every day now I see new startups come out of stealth that claim they can build a business with a prompt. In 2026 you are going to see people try that and do that and some of them will make money. The ones that make money are the ones that will have clarity. The ones that know what's worth building. Because it turns out the bottleneck was never putting the product on the website. It's knowing what product the customer wants. PRDs were always a substitute for clarity. They were a big hedge against expensive rework. They were a way to disambiguate and get to some clarity when you were facing a potentially risky investment, a six figure, seven figure investment in engineering time to get to a prototype. But now that can cost more. Writing a PRD can cost more than shipping the whole thing. And I'm not kidding. I have seen PRD cycles in my career at big companies take longer than Claude took to ship all of co-work. The second bottleneck is around ambition. Are you swinging hard enough when shipping requires a quarter of engineering time? Then small bets can make sense because I mean that's agile style, right? You don't want to you don't want to lock up engineering and increase your risk. You might have three or four shots per year. If you can increase that a little bit with agile style thinking, then that's great. But what if that's no longer a constraint? What if you can take, you know, every 10 days you can ship, every week you can ship, it's 50 swings a year. Suddenly your risk is timidity. Your risk is lack of courage. The danger isn't necessarily building the wrong thing because you got 50 shots to build the right thing. The danger is not building enough things toward a larger vision that is really transformative for the customer. And so I think that we're going to see a lot of cases where people are using AI to build horseless carriages, which is the old name for cars. It's what we called cars because we didn't have a mental model for a car when we first got them. We called them horseless carriages. We will see a lot of products that are horseless carriages floating around. And what we need to do is have the ambition and the eyes to see what is that 10x better product in our particular domains and shoot for that with multiple releases as quickly as we can. Distribution is another bottleneck that's becoming clear right now. When everybody can build, product is not really the moat that it was. Getting it into people's hands is a mode. My favorite example right now is Cognition makers of the AI coding agent Devon chose not to go and get distribution themselves even though they have a product that is an agentic coder that seems very on trend for 2026. Instead, they partnered with Infosys and they're deploying Devon across Infosys's third of a million person team and hitting all of their global client base. Why? Because Infosys has distribution. Infosys has decades of enterprise relationships. The technology is the easy part. Reaching customers is hard. And Cognition realized that an established brand was a way to do that. And that brings me to the last bottleneck, relationships. When capabilities are compounding really quickly and platforms and channels keep shifting and what worked last quarter might not be the right way to do it next quarter, the thing that is durable is relationships. You can't vibe code a relationship. And this is going to be a fractal truth. By which I mean it's true for individuals and it's true for companies. Companies in business relationships are going to have durable advantages by investing in those relationships. And you in your career individually will have a durable advantage by investing in your professional relationship so that you are known as a trusted person to do work with because if you have to turn to someone and technical skills are rapidly becoming a commodity you're going to turn to someone that you can trust to deliver on your work and that's a relationship thing. So, we've taken a tour through. We've seen how some of these constraints are shifting. We've seen how the AI native ways of working are upending our assumptions about execution. How do our habits need to change? Right now, most of the work habits we've embied are riskmanagement rituals designed for a world where execution was expensive. And they've sort of calcified. They've they've clotted into defaults that persist even though all of the unit economics in our world have flipped. You've probably felt this. You probably felt a sense that you're spending more time prepping for the work than you probably should. That there should be an easier way to do this. That maybe you're protecting something that doesn't need as much protection anymore. Maybe you're preparing for a meeting that doesn't need the kind of ritual it needs anymore. Let me get specific with you then. Let me suggest to you habits that made sense in the old model and are probably now actively costing you so that you can flip them and they can become the seeds of a more AI native way of working. Number one is the permission loop. The old logic is that doing something was typically expensive in time. So check before you do. Get buy in. Make sure you're building the right thing before you spend precious resources. Now we had management books for a long time that said we need to have more autonomy. we need to push delegation down, but those still didn't change the fundamental understanding that execution was costly. And so, yeah, you could take bias for action and write up a proposal, but if you're going to spend a quarter of engineering time, someone's going to need to sign off on that. That logic is now broken. Asking even for relatively large things still now takes longer than doing the email thread to get approval can take more time than building the prototype. Now it's that's the world we live in. The Slack conversation to confirm direction can take longer than trying both directions and just seeing what works. We are in a world where Manis just launched a feature that literally builds the presentation that you talk about in the meeting as you're having the meeting. approval processes were designed to reduce risk, but they don't anymore. They just add slowness. And so this means that our organizations need to shift because people need to be free to default to doing, to building the rough version, to showing it, to asking forgiveness when needed. we're going to make mistakes and to committing to a broader vision, a broader direction, something in line with the ambition of the business that they can reliably ship against autonomously. We need leaders who are able to cast that wider vision so teams can be more independent and ship relentlessly and autonomously against that vision. That's how you break the permission loop. Habit number two, polish as procrastination. The old logic was you get one shot so make it count. If execution is expensive, please don't waste it on something halfbaked. Look, I saw this show up in the when I was writing product requirement docs and PR FAQs at Amazon. You had one shot with a particular person you wanted to meet with and do a review with. You had to make it count. You had to polish it. You had to go through different reviews. Quality really mattered. And we spent a lot of time polishing to make sure those PRFAQs were as good as they could get. that's now broken. People are spending 80% of their time on the last 20% of quality when the marginal value of that polish is dropping quickly. And I want to be careful here. I am not saying that good thinking is going out of style. I am saying that polish is becoming a way to avoid getting your ideas rapidly in touch with reality. Because before when you needed to polish something, yeah, maybe you overpolished. It was still possible to do that, but at the end of the day, what you were trying to do is sharpen your ideas so you could derisk execution. And that made sense. Now, even a directionally correct, ambitious idea is enough to get going, which means that the value of shipping ugly is up and the rough version that exists is going to beat the polished version that doesn't. and you can always improve on it. And by the way, I'm not saying that consumers won't value polish. I think there's a huge amount of money to be made in polished UI for AI products. I think we have a lot of rough edges on a lot of our AI products. I use them a ton and so I don't mind them, but I have no illusions about the fact that we're leaving billions of dollars in market value on the table by not fully polishing out our products because we're shipping so fast. So take that as a goal, something we need to iterate on. But if you're getting started, if you're trying to get there quickly, you just got to ship and then you got to relentlessly optimize from there. And then you can polish as quickly as you can. Which by the way, if you're shipping fast, that path to polish looks really nice. I think Notebook LM is a great example here. They shipped, they got into market, they saw reaction, and they've been polishing that UI ever since. Habit number three, meetings as a default. Look, meetings are a function of people and one of the consequences of AI native teams is they tend to be smaller and so you get less meetings. But regardless of the size, the old logic was that you would get alignment before you got action. You would get everybody in the room so we don't waste expensive execution time building. You want to talk it through that now takes longer than building the prototype. An hour of six people's time is 6 hours of work. And that's often enough to just build the thing. Meetings still feel responsible, don't they? Meetings still distribute accountability. If the meeting decided something and it was wrong, it's not our fault. The meeting decided. And the worst part is this. Meetings about what to build often don't resolve what to build. They don't even answer the question. They'll surface opinions. They'll create action items and they'll create delays. AI is relentless about this. AI will show the truth here. Just build it. You have the time. Build it and show it. It might be bad. It might be good, but just build it. You can replace the meeting with a product demo. In fact, maybe the next time you schedule a meeting, just ask yourself, what if I built the rough version of this and showed people instead? That's what a lot of these AI native companies are doing. In fact, that's one of the foundational build principles that is animating the culture of cursor right now. Cursor thinks a lot about how code is a way of getting your your ideas into contact with reality and software. And one of the things that they've talked about in interviews over and over again is that they are about taking some of the croft, some of the extra, some of the planning that protected execution out of work so that everybody can just get in and like designers can commit and product can commit and engineering can commit and you can see your ideas meet the code and that saves meetings. Meetings are no longer a default. Number four, I call this structured waiting. I there may be a better word. The old logic was that coordination was important. Waiting for feedback was important because again you're wanting to protect execution time and keep it aligned. Everyone's time is precious. So you must respect the process. Wait for feedback. Wait for the sync. Wait for someone to unblock you. So much of work in older larger corporations is waiting. Waiting for approval. Waiting for feedback. Waiting for the next meeting for someone else to do their part. But most of what you're waiting for doesn't need to be waited for. and you end up outsourcing your momentum to other people's calendars. So, I'm going to suggest that you just stop waiting. Do the next thing while you wait for feedback on the first thing. Assume the answer is yes. This is another example of where leaders need to set the tone here because leaders need to cast a vision large enough that their teams always have something to work against, do not have to get stuck waiting and where they know that there's space to get forgiveness later when they're working in the correct direction. And we have tried to drill this in, if you're a leader, you've often tried to drill this in as a habit even before AI came along. But the cost here is much larger because waiting an hour in the 2010s was waiting an hour. Waiting an hour now is waiting a prototype. Like it's just much more valuable. And so if you're blocked on a decision, make a provisional decision now. Let people know what you picked and keep moving and see what happens. But get rid of structured waiting. Number five, we've inverted planning and doing. The old logic was very much measure twice, cut once. Planning is cheap. Execution is expensive. I actually had that drilled into me when I was coming up in product. I've watched people spend a week writing a plan, right? I've watched them spend two weeks. I've watched people spend eight weeks writing a plan at times. The plan ends up being a hedge and it ends up being much more expensive than the product will ever be. And ironically, the plan is almost always incorrect. It almost always never survives contact with reality. It's a truism in business. I'm just going to tell you, look at the planning that you're doing and see if you can cut the planning down. See if you can cut it. I don't know. Set a goal 90%. Can you cut your planning down by 90%. You probably can. See if you can replace that with learning through prototyping. See if you can replace that with a bold rough direction and aggressively shipping and optimizing for what works. If you haven't built something in the last couple of weeks at work or maybe at home if you're doing a home project, then you're probably overplanning. Let reality inform the plan instead of trying to predict reality with the plan. Because prediction, ironically, prediction has now become expensive and luxurious because execution and doing is cheap and execution and doing is more accurate and more reliable. Learning from customers directly by launching is more reliable. And so think about how much you're planning and see if you can cut it by 90%. I'm not kidding. See if you can cut it down and see if you can spend that energy on doing instead. Number six, the deck instead of the demo. That's an old habit, right? We build consensus and we create a deck and we make sure stakeholders can weigh in and we we have we call them a walking around deck. Does that ring a bell for you? The deck shows what we want to envision. It helps us to build uh alignment with various stakeholders. Sometimes we workshop that deck. Some I remember having to pick the fonts on that. Forget all of that. Build the demo. Show it. Does it does this sound like I'm beating the same drum? It should build a working prototype and show that instead of the deck. In some senses, work is getting much simpler now. All of the rituals that we prepared as a hedge against execution are in question. We should be asking if we need them. Why not just do the work? Why not just ship to customers? Habit number seven, consensus before action. Get everybody aligned. This is so deadly. And I know organizations tried to push on this by giving individual team leaders autonomy. Amazon had their two pizza teams. There were other versions of that. The difference now is that the cost of consensus has 10xed or 100xed. If consensus was expensive before in the 2010s, it is priceless now. And ironically, consensus often wasn't real anyway. People would often agree in meetings then undermine the decisions later. But regardless, it is too expensive now to practice the habit of consent. Let consensus come from the results that create alignment. Just try things. And again, this is going to be a leadership change as well as an individual contributor change. Nobody is exempt here. Leaders can't just say do this and then leave it up to people. But at the same time, if you're starting out on your own and you listen to this video and you're trying to set a new way of working, you're going to need some support from your manager and you're going to need to be explicit about that. I mean, you can share this video if you want, but lead by doing. Lead by showing that if you set an ambitious goal, if you set a larger vision for the business, you don't need to get consensus. You can just act in that direction and let results create alignment over time. I tried X and here's what happened is much more persuasive than let's agree to try X. Run the experiment first and then everyone will align when you get the data because people can see what actually works. And the thing is it's never been faster. It's never been faster to try that out. The last habit I want to call out is the habit of hoarding until ready. People who like to not show work until it's complete. Who think half finished work wastes other people's time. I was told that when I was a junior coming up. I was told, \"Don't submit this half-finish piece of work. This isn't good enough to show your manager yet. You need to finish it all the way. Come on, Nate. What are you doing?\" Well, that is reversed. Now, you're probably sitting on ideas and drafts and prototypes until they feel ready, which means you're getting feedback late after you've invested in a direction that might be incorrect. Again, this is a moment when we have to realize that the costs of things are changing. The cost of getting to a rapid version is so cheap now. We just have to be willing to show it. And that takes a little bit of ego death on our part. There's an ego component here. We have to be willing to show some work that's a little bit raw and unfinished. What if people think it's bad? What if people think it doesn't work? Those are the reactions that you need. What if you ship that prototype to the customer and they don't like it? Well, this is why we ship a lot and now we have that information. Finding out that you're wrong a week from now is better than finding out that you're wrong a month from now. And frankly, this puts a primacy on thinking clearly because one thing that doesn't go away like half finished work that is all AI slop and that you didn't put any thought to is going to show. In fact, it creates downstream work for your colleagues. But halffinish work where you put some thought in, you have a direction you want to go in and you just want some feedback on it and you want to show a quick prototype. That's different. Now you're putting thought into what's good or what's not. The through line here is pretty simple. All these eight habits are riskmanagement rituals that made sense when doing was expensive. And those unit economics have all flipped. And now the risk isn't wasting anybody's execution time, engineering or otherwise. It's wasting time on anything that isn't doing anything that isn't building. The permission loop is costing you more than the thing you're asking permission for. You get the idea, right? The polish costs more than shipping. Let me give you a couple examples of how this looks in practice. The old way might be you have an idea for improving a process internally. You write up a proposal. You schedule a meeting. The meeting surfaces questions. You update the proposal. Maybe weeks later, you get the approval to try a pilot. The new way, you get an idea. You spend an afternoon building a rough version. You show three people, two of them have concerns that killed the idea. Good, you found out in a day rather than a month. Or they like it and you go ahead and iterate and pilot and launch from there. The whole thing took x less time. Or the old way, you're working on a presentation for leadership. You spend a week on the deck. You refine the transitions. You words smmith the messages. You anticipate the objection. Leadership asks questions. Now you spend maybe two hours, maybe 20 minutes on a rough deck. You just want to get the alignment. You send it to your boss. This is rough. Does the direction make sense? She flags two problems you didn't consider. You fixed them in 10 minutes and the final deck took maybe an hour and a half and it's actually better because you got the feedback early. Stop treating process as a prerequisite and start treating iteration and trying to get your ideas into contact with reality as the process. The rough version is going to be the gold standard because we can get to it so much more quickly. Now, there's a counterargument here I want to call out. In some places, you're going to hear quality matters in my domain. My boss expects a plan. I'm going to get in trouble if I just do things without asking. That's fair. The habits I'm describing have different impacts in fields with high legal and compliance risks. Let's say you're in medicine and you have very high compliance risks. But here's what I would ask. How much of the process you're following is actually required? And how much is it just the way things have always been done in that environment? And most of us when we're honest realize that we probably have more latitude than we're using. And the habits that feel mandatory are often just the defaults that nobody has questioned before. And so the risk feels significant. But if we have our eye on quality in those fields in medicine, in law, in finance, then we are going to be in line with compliance even if we get there more quickly. And if you want a place to start, pick the habit that I suggested, one of the eight. Pick the one that feels lowest stakes to you, right? And just just break that habit. Just give it a try. Try a simpler way to do it. Maybe it's shipping something without the usual polish. Maybe it's skipping a meeting and instead of a brainstorm, you just build the thing. Maybe it's stopping waiting. You're blocked on a decision. Instead of waiting, you make the decision. You say, \"This is what I'm deciding.\" And you do the work. My my goal is not to get you to break rules here. My goal is to get you to discover that the principle of AI native work in AI is recognizing where value is really coming from in your work. It's not coming from protecting execution anymore. It's coming from doing the execution quickly and doing it within a framework where you have the ambition, the boldness to build something really meaningful, to solve meaningful customer problems, to do what you need to do to deliver value. The people who figure this out first are going to be operating at a velocity that feels a lot more like Anthropic, a lot more like cursor and a lot less like a traditional big company, right? You name your big company. And it won't be because they have better tools because almost everybody is getting the fancy tools now. It's because they will have stopped doing the things that are no longer worth doing in a world where execution is cheap. And so they'll be shipping while other people plan. They'll be iterating while other people align. They'll be learning while other people polish. If we circle back to the beginning of this video, I talked about this idea that we live in a world of chaos. And we need a simplifier. The chaos you're feeling is not random. It's the gap between where the bottleneck has moved and the habits you still have today. When you close that gap, when you start to align your work habits to how AI actually changes scarcity in the business to how AI enables execution and you recognize where where there's other scarcity in the business that needs your business judgment, suddenly you're going to know where to spend your time. You're going to know why you need to move faster and the chaos is going to start making sense. You're going to understand why meetings can't be the default anymore. You're going to understand that the next time someone ships a vibecoded this or that, it's not just one more piece of AI news. It's someone who recognized that they needed to get their idea into contact with reality quickly. And you're going to recognize the truly precious resources that are good for your career and that help businesses thrive are still going to be true in the age of AI and are even more true now when execution is cheap. Things like clarity, like ambition, like distribution. the bottlenecks that are appearing and growing more and more scarce as execution driven by AI gets more and more pervasive. And so in a world where we're going to get, I guarantee it, another major AI release tomorrow, worry less about what execution is enabling a company to do, and worry more about your ability to shift your work habits and your ability to practice getting your ideas into contact with reality, solving real customer problems, and shifting your attention to the things that are actually difficult to do, the things that require good human judgment. It's hard to get clear on things. It's hard to be ambitious. We tend to think smaller than we should. Distribution is a hard thing to tackle. Most entrepreneurs actually overindex on product and underindex on go to market. That's not new. But distribution is exponentially more valuable now. So that's my challenge to you. In a world that is chaotic, recognize that so much of the chaos comes from being out of sync with where AI is pushing scarcity in your business. It feels out of sync because AI is making execution so cheap and everything is changing because of that. Let's get that figured out and things are going to start to get smoother.",
