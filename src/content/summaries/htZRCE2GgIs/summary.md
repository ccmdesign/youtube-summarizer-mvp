  title: "The 10% of AI Tools that Drive 90% of My Results"
  description: "⚡️ HubSpot’s Free Guide: https://clickhubspot.com/5c4cca


    Every AI tool excels at one thing. #ChatGPT follows complex instructions without dropping steps. #Gemini handles video, audio, and massive files other models can't process. #Claude produces working code and polished copy on the first try. Perplexity fetches accurate information in seconds. NotebookLM answers only from your sources, so it can't hallucinate.


    This video breaks down when to use each tool based on three years of daily use, first at Google and now as a creator. Part 1 covers Everyday AI and Specialist AI. Part 2 covers Creative and Productivity AI.

## Key Takeaways

The most effective AI productivity strategy is selecting tools based on their unique strengths rather than using one for everything. The key insights are:

*   **Match the tool to the task:** Each leading AI has a distinct "superpower"—ChatGPT's **obedience**, Gemini's **multimodality**, Claude's **draft quality**, Perplexity's **search speed**, and Notebook LM's **source-grounded accuracy**.

*   **Use a layered workflow:** Start a project with ChatGPT/Gemini for ideation and research, then use Claude for final polishing and code generation.

*   **Specialist vs. Generalist:** Use general chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) for reasoning and creation, and specialist tools (Perplexity, Notebook LM) for specific tasks like verification and fact-checking.

## Summary

Jeff Su explains that his productivity comes from using a small set of AI tools, each chosen for a specific, superior capability. He groups them into "Everyday AI" (general chatbots) and "Specialist AI" (task-optimized tools).

### Everyday AI: General-Purpose Chatbots

*   **ChatGPT's Superpower: Obedience.** It reliably follows lengthy, complex checklists without skipping steps, making it ideal for tasks where missing one instruction breaks the whole process (e.g., creating a detailed hiring rubric).

*   **Gemini's Superpower: Multimodality & Massive Context.** It natively processes video, audio, images, and text together within a 1-million-token context window. It's the best tool for synthesizing information from mixed media, like turning a meeting recording, slides, and whiteboard photo into a summary and follow-up email.

*   **Claude's Superpower: High-Quality First Drafts.** It excels at producing near-final output on the first try, particularly for **coding** (writing functional scripts) and **polishing copy** (matching tone and style from examples).

**Workflow Integration:** Use ChatGPT or Gemini at the *beginning* of work for brainstorming and research, then hand off the rough output to Claude for the *final polish*.

### Specialist AI: Task-Optimized Tools

*   **Perplexity's Superpower: Fast, Accurate Fetching.** It's fine-tuned for search, delivering specific facts (e.g., restaurant details, token limits) within seconds. Think of it as a replacement for Google's AI search mode, not a general reasoning chatbot.

*   **Notebook LM's Superpower: Source-Grounded Answers.** It only answers using documents you provide, minimizing hallucinations. It's perfect for verifying that drafts (like marketing materials or video scripts) don't contradict source information.

The core principle is **tool-task fit**. Most people only need a paid ChatGPT subscription, but power users can mix tools to leverage each one's unique strength.

## Context

As AI tools proliferate, professionals face analysis paralysis—wasting time testing dozens of tools instead of getting work done. This video provides a crucial mental model for cutting through the noise. It matters for knowledge workers, creators, and anyone using AI for productivity, as it shifts the focus from "which tool is best overall" to "which tool is best *for this specific job*." This reflects the broader trend of AI tool specialization, where foundational models are being fine-tuned for distinct use cases, expanding the total utility of AI.
