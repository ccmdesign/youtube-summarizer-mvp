title: How Cursor Works Internally (Context, Models, Speculative Decoding)
description: >-
  Cursor feels magical — but there’s no magic here.


  In this video, we break down how Cursor actually works internally — from
  editor instrumentation and context selection to embeddings, speculative
  decoding, model orchestration, and safety layers.


  You’ll learn:

  - How Cursor infers developer intent from editor signals

  - How it selects relevant context under strict token limits

  - How codebase indexing and semantic search work

  - How multiple AI models are orchestrated in real time

  - Why speculative decoding makes Cursor feel fast

  - How safety layers like shadow workspaces prevent bad edits


  This video is designed for developers, engineers, and anyone curious about how
  modern AI-powered IDEs are built.
