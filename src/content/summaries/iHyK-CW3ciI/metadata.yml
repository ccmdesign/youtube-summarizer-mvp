title: OpenAI Releases ChatGPT AI Agent Skills
description: >-
  Today I break down a big news item I think is flying under the radar: OpenAI
  quietly launched Skills for Codex, and I explain what that means (and how it
  differs from sub-agents and MCPs). I then share a fast-moving trend I’m
  watching and why it’s a strong wedge for a simple app. After that, I recommend
  the to-do app I’ve used for 14 years and give away a startup idea. I close
  with a practical 6-step framework for going from idea → viral validation →
  mobile app launch in 2026.

  00:40 – AI New Item: OpenAI launches Skills for Codex

  09:33 – Startup Idea: Call-an-expert service for non-developers stuck at 80%
  done

  14:44 – Framework: Viral Mobile App Framework


  Key Points


  * OpenAI “Skills” make Codex/ChatGPT more reusable and consistent by packaging
  repeatable workflows.

  * A “skill” is the recipe, a “sub-agent” is extra worker instances, and an
  “MCP” is the tool access plug.

  * Face yoga is an emerging sub-niche with clear app potential (simple
  routines, monetization via paid or ads).

  * Last 20 is a practical marketplace idea: pay for 15 minutes of expert
  unblock help to finish the last 20%.

  * Viral validation favors apps that are visually obvious, explainable in three
  words, and tied to insecurity-driven outcomes.


  Numbered Section Summaries


  * OpenAI Skills: The Quiet Upgrade I walk through OpenAI’s launch of Skills
  for Codex—reusable bundles of instructions/scripts/resources that can be
  called directly or chosen automatically. I’m excited because this makes agent
  workflows more consistent and scalable across tasks.


  * The Foundation: Skill vs Sub-Agent vs MCP I clarify the taxonomy: a skill is
  the written playbook, sub-agents are extra “worker” copies of the model that
  split a big job, and MCPs are what let the model access external systems like
  tickets or repos. This is the mental model I want everyone using going into
  2026.


  * The Trend: Face Yoga As An App Wedge I share a niche trend I’m seeing—face
  yoga—and why it’s a product opportunity similar to how yoga apps became huge.
  I call out the obvious app angles: guided routines, jawline/face-slimming
  programs, and content-driven growth via short videos.


  * The Tool: Things (My Simple Focus System) I recommend the Things to-do app
  because it’s simple: “Today,” “Upcoming,” and “Someday,” without a monthly
  fee. I also note what’s missing (I’d like more AI features), but it still wins
  for focus if you don’t want a “kitchen sink” system.


  * The Startup Idea: Last 20 (Phone-A-Friend For Vibe Coders) I give away the
  idea: builders get stuck at 80% after using Cursor/Replit/V0, so Last 20
  matches them with someone who’s solved that exact wall before. The product is
  a fast screen-share session—problem solved—priced per session or bundled for
  teams/agencies, with the marketplace taking a cut.


  * The Distribution Framework: Viral Validation → Launch I share a 6-step
  process: warm up the account, design a visually obvious app, build a tiny MVP
  fast, post daily until something hits, build the community before the product,
  then launch with a hard paywall and keep content rolling. It’s a simple
  playbook for getting to organic traction in 2026.
