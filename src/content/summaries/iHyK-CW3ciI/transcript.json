  "fullText": "What's up everyone? Welcome to the Startup Ideas podcast. Today is December 22nd. I'm going to talk about a huge news item. Open AAI quietly launched something not a lot of people are talking about. I'm going to talk about one trend you could take advantage of, build a business around. I'm going to talk about one app that I'm using that, [music] you know, I I think you should, too. I'm going to talk about one startup idea and just give it away to you. And at the end, I'm going to give you a mobile app framework so you can actually go and build a mobile app in 2026. And that's today's episode. [music] >> So the news item I want to talk about um that I don't think a lot of people are talking about is quietly open AI has launched skills. So we've seen anthropic and claude skills. A lot of people talking about that including myself how amazing it is. But quietly we have codecs now officially support skills. Skills are reusable bundles of instructions, scripts, and resources that help Codeex complete specific tasks. You can call a skill directly with dollar signs skill name or let codeex choose the right one based on your prompts. So, what's really cool is they're just following the agent skills IO standard, the one uh by Anthropic. A skill is just a folder, basically an MD uh skill.md file for instructions and metadata. Um, and all of a sudden, your chat GBT and codec has just become a lot more valuable. So there's a tons tons of ways uh that you're going to be able to use agent skills within codeex or chat GBT. Um, you know, it gives some examples here in the offic in the official announcement, some technical stuff cuz it's talking about codecs uh specifically, but like a notion spec to implementation uh skill, a have codec read and update your linear tickets uh skill, have codeex automatically fix your GitHub CI failures skill. So it does a lot of things and um you know I think a lot of people don't really understand the difference between what is a skill, what is a sub agent and what is an MCP. So just to you know give everyone a little bit of a foundation a skill is like a written guide that tells you know code or you know codeex or chat gpt exactly how to do a specific task. for example, analyze spreadsheets this way or write emails in this voice or design uh you know, design the interface like this. So you can basically call and reuse the same skill again. Um and it just it allows for more consistent output. So what is a sub aent? Well, a sub agent is making a few extra copies of, you know, the LLM that you're using, you know, code or or codeex or chatbt, each with its own job, such as you review the code, you write tests, you update docs. The main the main LLM can hand out pieces of a big task to help these workers. So, work happens in parallel and stays organized. And an MCP is just a universal power plug that lets the LLM access other tools like we saw uh that you know it's going to update your linear tickets. Well, it needs access to that and that's through MCPS. So, highly encourage everyone kind of you know plays around with this. Um you can you can see over here uh on agentskills.io. I'll include it in the show notes. It kind of explains a little more about what uh what agent skills are. Says here it's an open format, a simple open format for giving agents new capabilities and expertise. Agent skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that can discover and use to do more accurately and efficiently. And who doesn't want that? Says how you know what an agent skill can enable. Uh domain expertise. So package specialized knowledge into reusable instructions from legal review processes to data pipelines. New capabilities where you can give agents, you know, new capabilities like creating presentations or building MCP servers, uh repeatable workflows, interoperability. So uh yeah, there's a lot there. There's some example skills that they give as well on GitHub. And I just think that not not a lot of people are talking about it. So, I had to I had to let you know about it. Um, so that's the one news item that I think you should be paying attention to uh that that could be super valuable for you in 2026. If you have a business that's doing at least $50,000 a month in revenue, I've got something interesting for you. It's called offline mode. It's a 2-day event that me and my team are putting on at a 20,000 plus foot square foot mansion. Yes, this is what it looks like on January 23rd and January 24th in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I'll include a link in the description if you're interested in coming, but it's basically for people who have a business that's kind of cranking, but they really want to put it in rocket ship mode. They want to create a set of businesses that generate tons of money, tons of cash flow, tons of product market fit, tons of impact. Um, but they're not just quite there yet. It's also about, you know, making your business AI first. How you can actually, you know, build not just one product, but multiple products. And you're going to leave with, you know, tactical, uh, answers to your questions. So, um, if that's you and this sounds interesting, uh, I'll see you there. So, that's the news item. The ne the trend that, uh, I've been hearing about, um, is is something called face yoga. Don't know if you've heard about it, but uh if you go I'm gonna go on to idea browser and just check the trend face yoga. You know, I'm sure you've heard of yoga obviously. Um but people are s, you know, doing these like face yoga techniques to to get slimmer faces. Um and there's a lot of opportunity here if you want to create different apps. Um cuz there are, you know, a ton of opportunities um you know, in yoga, right? There's people making millions of dollars a year with these yoga apps. Um but face yoga is kind of a subniche that I think is interesting. Um and is getting a ton of volume. You know, you're seeing, you know, 110,000 searches in August. Um the average [clears throat] CBC is about a dollar. The competition is low. Um, and I just think that you're going to see opp Yeah, I think there's an opportunity to build products, apps, you know, around face workouts, facial exercises, face yoga, um, face lifting yoga exercises, jawline trainer, face slimming exercises. So, there's a lot of opportunity here. A trend I never heard of heard of, but face yoga. Face yoga involves facial exercises, stretches, massage to tone facial muscles, potentially reducing signs of aging like wrinkles and sagging by firming the skin. Much like body yoga strengthens muscles, offering a natural and holistic way to improve facial definition. Um, you can even see here people are creating uh YouTube videos on it. 10-minute cheek lift face yoga tone, right? like there's an opportunity to build an app that's you know just some of these exercises and and you can charge for it. Um or make it free and do uh advertising or sponsorship. So um face yoga a trend I have recently heard of that uh hey might get your creative juices flowing. Uh, one app that, uh, I wanted to talk about, um, that I've been using literally for 14 years. Um, and you know, some of you have heard of this one. It's the things to-do list app. So, it's by a company called Culture Code. I'm not affiliated with them at all. And it's the to-do list app. People often ask me like, \"How do I how do I stay focused? How do I, you know, um cuz I'm working on multiple companies and and a lot of people work for, you know, with me and stuff like that. And I keep everything in to-do list and it's just uh sorry, into things, not to-do list as my to-do list. And what I like about it, it has like what I'm focusing on today, what is my upcoming, and what is something I want to do someday. Um and it isn't a monthly fee, it's just like a onetime fee. Um, there is some stuff to be desired here. I will say like I could use some AI features and stuff like that, but overall if you're looking for like a simple to-do list app, I just find this things to be the simplest the simplest one there. Um, and I've tried other things. I've tried more intensed ones. Um, ones that are around like the GTD framework and and and sort of more Yeah. like kind of more the kitchen sink type apps. But I don't know, I always come back to things, does what I need to do, and I recommend it. I recommend it for people who are looking for a simple to-do list app. Let's give away a startup idea. So, uh the startup idea of today is is one um that uh was on the like, you know, here you can check here. Every day for the last 24 days, we've been giving away a free startup idea. Here's day 22. I'll include the link uh in the show notes if you want to. You get these ideas for free. You just got to claim them. So today's idea I really like. It says call an expert service for non-developers stuck at 80% done. So how many of us have built a vibecoded app and are like 80% of the way there? We use things like you know cursor or replet or vzero um and then we kind of just give up. So the idea is something called last 20. Last 20 is a phone of friend for builders who are almost there. Upload your code, describe the block, get matched with an expert who's hit that wall before and knows the way around it. 15 minutes on a screen share. That's it. Problem solved. Basically, hire a fi vibe coder. Ship it. Maybe you charge $15 to $50 per session. Or maybe you do a yearly thing for agencies. Maybe it's like $100 to $500 a year who can't afford stalled client work. Experts set their rates. So you basically create this marketplace and then you charge a percentage. Maybe it's 5, 10, 15%. So many of us are becoming vibe coders, right? There's literally millions of us, but we're, you know, at the end of it, we're kind of just like, ah, [sighs] how do I do this one thing? Um, and there's so many, you know, I think this is so true. There's so many YouTube comments of people being like, how do I do this? agency slack channels asking has anyone shipped this integration for? Okay. So, here is the the main, you know, hire a vibe coder, phone a friend, uh, opportunity. And if you, uh, look at the search data, it's absolutely beautiful. Um, you know, AI helpers, uh, AI tutors, all this sort of stuff is just going up and to the right. And I I think that's why it's such a huge opportunity. Uh, it scored a 9 on 10. Uh, the problem is a severe pain. I don't think it's, you know, the feasibility is a five on 10. like it's not that hard to do. Um and the why now 9 out of 10 perfect timing. So um you know I think uh I always check the the value letter and idea browser is just some get your creative juices flowing around uh how you can actually go and build this uh this product. So, I would start with like a lead magnet around an AI project roadblock guide with with the goal just to get people's email addresses, get their phone numbers. Then you do a front-end offer, so premium access to an AI help tool. Then the core offer, expert help sessions, you do like a pay per session, access to expert advice, and then eventually you layer on the annual subscription offering priority access and additional features. Um, and then eventually you do the agency thing, right? you do the enterprise package. So I think this is sort of the ladder um and uh you know the key stages here just like why I like the value ladder. I've talked about this before but it's basically you give free value to build trust and capture leads. That's the u the guide. You do the front-end offer which is like a low ticket product to convert leads to buyers. That's that premium access to an AI help tool. So maybe it's like a Chrome extension that allows users to capture AI project issues and submit them to experts. And I know someone's like, \"Oh, Chrome extension, it's going to be so hard to create.\" Um, well, with cursor and things like that, you know, it it it's not out of the realm of possibility to create it. And you can use, you know, you could you probably can create something pretty lightweight that that does this. Um, and uh, yeah, so I I overall I think this is an interesting idea. I think the I think it would it would do quite well. And um, I hope someone takes it. I hope someone does it. And uh, please let me know how it goes and as you build it. Um, cuz I would I I would actually use this. You can even, by the way, just do this idea for like one product. So, Replet has Replet bounties, which is sort of this idea where you can hire someone to help you with Replet. But this is basically Replet bounties for all the different vibe coding tools, cursor, vzero, you you name it. So, uh you can even just do like vzero bounties.com. um and or just focus on one platform or cursor cursorhelp.com or text a cursor um text a cursorcoder or something like that.com. I do think that last 20 is like a very catchy name. So, so I I do think someone should take that idea, but um thinking about doing this on one particular channel first, one particular platform, and then eventually expanding this to all the different vibe coding tools. I think that's that's the move. We're going to end this episode with a framework. Uh this is a framework I saw on Instagram by a account called Builder Cult. Um, so it it's basically here's the six-step playbook to viral validation. So let's just talk about, you know, if you're building an app, how can you get viral validation? So the first step is warm up your account. So you sign up to an Instagram account, you sign up to a Tik Tok account, warm warm it up. Watch videos in your niche every single day of the week. Comment, like, share, follow like-minded creators. And this prevents shadow bands. Um, so many people just create a brand account and then uh start posting stuff and it's not, you know, not really working. Well, it's not really working cuz the platforms are trying to prevent shadow bands. Step two is to design the idea. So you, you know, your app must have one visually heavily uh visually heavy element. Example, pimple pop popping. Um, must be explainable in three words. Track your acne. This is just an example and must solve a fund fundamental human insecurity. Uh lose weight, uh productivity, height, class, this sort of thing, right? So you want to the the apps that do the best are just sort of the the simplest apps that you can explain so simply that you know just in a few words that you can very important uh have one visually heavy element because that's going to be helpful when you're creating organic content that you hope to get go viral. Step three is to build the simplest MVP you can. So do something like literally three screens minimum. embarrassing s embarrassingly simple. Um, give yourself 2 to three days to build it. You can use, you know, roor.app, that's a mobile app builder. You can use anything.com that's a mobile app builder. You can use vibe code app. That's a mobile app builder. Um, but yeah, give yourself a couple days, iterate on it, show it to friends, show it to people, DM it to people and and get their get their feedback. Post. Step four is post daily until one goes viral. That's the goal. So, you're going to want to create one video per day for 30 days minimum, uh, or four videos per week. You're going to want to test different angles of the same app idea, and hopefully one will catch. They say in this one will catch. That's not true. Not necessarily it will catch in 30 days. It might take you 60, 90, 120, but you know, it's shots on net. Um, but you'll know when one hits because the comments will explode. Step five is to build the community. um you know before the product. So you have this like weight list, right? So you create a Discord um they say Telegram. I'm not a huge fan of Telegram. Discord, WhatsApp for the weight list or an email newsletter for the weight list. Post updates like building the app. Here's what I'm adding. This keeps early believers engaged while you uh while you're building it and you're iterating and converts into day one users. And then finally launch the app once it's secure and stuff like that. Finalize features. convert the the [snorts] ROR or anything or vibe code app into a full-fledged product using um cloud code launch with a hard payw wall something like superw wall um.com post content daily you know different angles same value and then hopefully scale from 0 to 10k MR purely organic so that is today's episode uh I hope you enjoyed it I'm trying this new format where I'm giving uh a news item, a trend, an app, a startup idea, a framework, all the alpha to give you the highest probability of winning because I want to see you win in 2026. If you've gotten to this far, please, please like and comment and subscribe. Share this with a friend. I read every single comment that you write, so I will see you in there. And uh yeah, have a have a creative day, my friends. And I'll see you next time.",
