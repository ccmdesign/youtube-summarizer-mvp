description: >-
  People aren’t just searching on Google anymore. They’re searching on
  Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube—and that shift is redefining SEO in 2026. In
  this video, I break down how social platforms have become the new search
  engines, how discovery now starts in the feed, and why creators and brands
  must optimize for social search to stay visible.


  You’ll learn which platforms matter most for B2B vs B2C, how people actually
  search using full questions (not keywords), how to structure content so
  algorithms can index it, and why on-platform actions like saves, DMs, and
  native checkout now influence reach and rankings. If you want to be found
  where attention actually lives, this is the complete playbook.
