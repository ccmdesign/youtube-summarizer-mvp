  "fullText": "Hey everyone, Rogue Gold here and today the time has finally come to discuss The Division 3 once again. Believe it or not, it has been an entire year since we did any kind of an update video on the project. That's right, beginning of 2025, we checked in and here we are again. And for the time being, I think that is the appropriate path to take here. Of course, when and if more information starts coming out, I'll be the first to cover it. But this period of development that the team is in, it's not a very outwardfacing one. They are developing tools, doing heavy research, putting together the building blocks for the game. And so that means that for the time being, not much is going to make its way to us, the players. In our update video last year, I predicted that we would get virtually no news about The Division 3 in 2025, and that ended up being correct for better or worse. Just to let you know upfront, I feel similarly about 2026. I doubt that we will be hearing much from the Division 3 team. However, I do believe that there is one key moment upcoming this year that the devs may decide to capitalize on in order to deliver us our first details about the game. Exciting, I know, and we'll get into all of it. And then in addition, we'll cover some of the other noteworthy developments and changes that have happened behind the scenes since our last project update. I don't plan on retreading too much of what we covered last year. So, if you want to get a sense of who some of the key players are in The Division 3's development, a few fundamentals that we can be pretty sure as for what the final product will be, then I highly encourage you check out that video first or after this one. I'll have it linked down in the description below for easy access as we dive in. If you enjoy this one and you want to stay locked in for any updates we get on The Division 3 from here on out, then be sure to subscribe. A major shout out and thank you to our channel members. As always, your commitment to me and this channel is more appreciated than you know. Without further ado, however, let's dive in. So, to begin, let's just get caught up to speed. Have there been any updates on the project since we last spoke of it at the beginning of 2025? Technically, but not really. Sort of. It's more of a reading between the lines situation, if you catch my drift. As far as actual comments from the team, just about the only notable acknowledgements we got throughout 2025 was from Julian Gity, who is currently serving as executive producer for the Division brand at large, but is also overseeing Division 3 development. Back in August, around the time that The Division team flew out to attend Gamescom, someone replied to him on Twitter stating, \"Haven't seen you in a while. Have you found a team making Division 3?\" And his one-word response was, \"We,\" which if you don't know means yes in French. So yeah, maybe now you can begin to see why I didn't have much of a reason to make an update video throughout 2025, but I wanted to highlight this comment in particular as it leads us into what is probably the most significant shift that has happened behind the scenes since we last talked, and that is Massive Entertainment itself. Massive, if you don't know, is the development studio that created The Division IP and has spearheaded development of the series ever since the first game. They are of course the ones leading development on The Division 3, but this time last year their focus as a studio was split. We knew they were working on The Division 3 as it was confirmed all the way back in 2023. However, it was widely believed that they also were working on an additional AAA project among other evidence. At the time, there was a multitude of job hirings listed, some that explicitly stated The Division 3 as the project, but many that were for an unannounced title. This wasn't a huge shock given the studio had grown enough to support two AAA teams with development of Avatar Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws running concurrently throughout much of the early 2020s. But it was definitely one aspect that left some Division fans disheartened, myself included. We'd hoped that we might see them return to their roots after the release of Avatar and Star Wars and commit the entirety of their resources back to The Division. Things began to change though around the middle of 2025. All those job listings that had been up, very suddenly they all vanished. Reports came out about the cancellation of a Star Wars Outlaws 2, which while not confirmed to be in development at Massive, logically seems like it would have been there. And although I was a surprise to hear that the Avatar team had been cooking up an all-new DLC for the 2023 game, which launched last month to coincide with the new Avatar movie that released, creative director Omar Buelli parttooken in Ask Me Anything on the game's official Reddit page in which he confirmed that there are currently no plans for future content after the release of the newest DLC. So, if no new AAA project is spinning up and if Outlaws and Avatar content has all wrapped up, that just leaves one thing, Division. And I think all of this is well encapsulated in this press release that Massive put out back in October. Now, this initially caused a lot of confusion and push back from the public as the second paragraph in particular announces that the studio is enacting a voluntary career transition program. uh which to many just sounded like a fancy corporate way to avoid saying layoffs. And to be clear, I do not want to nor intend to ever defend any kind of initiative that causes hardworking developers to lose jobs against their will. However, now having some of this additional context, and after speaking to a few sources within Massive at the time, in actuality, this is all far less nefarious than many made it out to be. The truth is that Massive went through some pretty radical transformation across the past decade. They went from a studio working all united as one on a military shooter. Then Avatar spun up, later Star Wars, transitioning them to become a much more fantastical licensed game studio and one that was handling two major games at once. But now the pendulum has swung back. They're shifting back to The Division and refocusing into one team. And so that not only introduces the possibility of some roles being overcrowded as there's now just one main project to focus on, but it also means that for many who join the studio in the past 5 years thinking they'd get to work on one type of game, that's now been flipped entirely on its head. So all of that is to say that it is my understanding that no huge wave of layoffs occurred as some tried to spin. rather those who do not want to be committed to working at a division focused studio for the foreseeable future have the opportunity to look elsewhere for work and get some assistance in doing so. And that in turn might help Massive in figuring out the jigsaw puzzle of where to place everybody under the new paradigm. The bottom line for all of this and what I think stands out most for Division fans and those who are anticipating The Division 3, as of 2026, Massive is back to being a Division focused studio. With that same press release confirming that they are committed to The Division 2, the Division 2 Survivors, the Division Resurgence, and The Division 3. And at least largely those working on these projects have chosen to. They're committed and invested in this IP. And I think having developers who hold genuine passion for what they work on is a hugely underrated boon in game development. So with it having been over a year since Groundwork began on The Division 3 and with Massive now being on the other side of realigning the studio to focus on the game as its one core AAA project, that leaves us in a pretty good position as it means that the likely hundreds of developers in place working on it can really begin to pick up the pace. That then takes us to the internet's number one question. When is this thing releasing? We can talk all day about what's happening with development, who is working on what, yada yada, but all people really care about is when do I get to play it? Well, obviously we still don't have any official release date or window here at the beginning of 2026. In my video last year, I gave the prediction that I believe The Division 3 would release in 2028, or if not then, then certainly no sooner than 2028. And for now, that is still what I'm sticking with. What's difficult as far as predicting at this point in time is that we have very little to go off of. And by that, I mean, ever since Division 3 was announced, I've seen people offer wildly optimistic predictions and timelines for release, largely fueled by the fact that it only took Division 2 3 years to make and ship. What you have to keep in mind, though, is that there are some big differences between the leap from 1 to two and what will be the leap from two to three. Division 2 did not have to make a console or technological generation leap. It released on the Xbox One and the PS4, same as the Division 1, and only implemented some more subtle engine improvements on the back end. Comparatively though, Division 3 has the potential of pushing being two full generations later by the time it finally releases. And in the past nearly 7 years since The Division 2 came out, a lot has changed with the expectations, features, and technology used for AAA game development. What we also don't have a very clear picture of is what, if any, additional Ubisoft studios are supporting Division 3 development. One of the only reasons The Division 2 was able to be cranked out in under three years is because it had at its peak over 1,000 developers working on it with multiple support studios dedicating major amounts of resources to aid Massive with their efforts. Today, things are very different. Redstorm, which was for many years the foremost Division support studio, is now a shell of its former self, having laid off many longtime Division veterans and moving what few members it has left onto support for Rainbow 6. That's just one example. But overall, Ubisoft is in a time of major transformation as well, and I don't think we can count on all of this outside support being readily available to pitch in. So again, while I think 2028 is the absolute earliest that anyone should expect to see The Division 3 release, it wouldn't shock me if it ends up slipping into 2029. We'll just have to wait and see what we learn. So, I know you're probably hearing those dates and thinking, \"Well, that sucks. Looks like we're not going to be hearing anything about the game for a long time.\" And while I don't think keeping expectations low in this case is a bad idea, I do want to offer you a glimmer of hope, one possible Hail Mary as for where we might get our very first concrete details about The Division 3 in 2026. And that's because we have a very special event for The Division franchise at large coming our way this year. And it's coming up quite soon. March 8th, 2026 will mark the 10th anniversary of the release of the original Tom Clancy's The Division. That's right. The Division is turning 10 years old, and The Division teams have already communicated to us quite clearly that they have some big surprises and plans in store to celebrate. This road map was published all the way back in August, a whole 7 months prior to March. And yet, the 10th anniversary has its own dedicated card. So, whatever is in store, it seems as though it's been thoroughly planned and mapped out. Now, to be explicitly clear, so far there have been no indications or teasers given that they have plans to give us any sort of information on The Division 3 during the 10th anniversary. And even if they do plan to, they're most certainly not going to tell us in advance, right? But to me, it would just make a lot of sense. 10 years of any video game franchise is significant, and the devs have already acknowledged as much for our community. And I can't see much of a better way to honor where we've been and give a tease of where we are headed than to drop the first hints about the third game. Now, to be clear, if they were to release anything Division 3 related at the anniversary, do not expect to see gameplay, a trailer, anything like that. At least, I would not expect those things. I think it's far too early. Instead, my mind goes more towards a logo reveal like they did when they first showed us Division 2's logo during the second anniversary stream back in 2018. Or perhaps a confirmation of what location Division 3 will be set in, if we're lucky, accompanied by a concept art image or two. Something substantial enough to keep the community theories and speculation going, but nothing too crazy because again, I think it is simply too early for them to realistically give us anything like that. So yeah, I personally would not expect any Ubisoft Forward or Game Awards style reveals for The Division 3 in 2026, but maybe, just maybe, they'll drop us some crumbs during the 10th anniversary. And fortunately, we won't have to wait long to find out as March will be here before we know it. Well, there you have it, folks. That is the state of The Division 3 in 2026. Feels good to do a debrief like this again. I was honestly shocked when I looked back and saw that we never did another one after the 2025 update. But yeah, things have been quiet, which for now I would say is a good sign. Let the team cook and hopefully we get the absolute best once it is eventually ready to be shown. At this point, I would love to get all of your guys' thoughts on this. Heading into 2026, knowing how long we still have to go, where are your anticipation levels at for The Division 3? Have you updated your release date predictions at all? Do you think there's truly a chance that we might see some news on the project in March at the 10th anniversary? Let me know. I'll be very curious to read through everybody's thoughts. That's going to do it for me today, though, y'all. Thank you so much for coming by and watching. And until I see you next Roguel. Oh, we just got a rabbitous. I might not be friendly. coming to the division two. Let's go.",
