## Key Takeaways

Claude Canvas expands the utility of terminal-based AI by adding a visual layer to traditionally text-only coding agents.

* **Custom Interface Rendering**: Uses the **Ink** React library to build interactive CLI components like flight seat maps and email templates directly in the terminal.

* **Technical Stack**: Built on **Bun** and **Type

Script**, leveraging **T-mux** split-panes to provide a side-by-side display for the AI and its visual output.

* **Interactive IPC**: Features **Inter-Process Communication**, allowing the UI pane to send user selections (such as choosing a flight seat) back to the Claude agent for further action.

* **Agentic Potential**: Signals a shift toward AI agents managing personal logistics like emails and calendars through **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integrations.

## Summary

### The Evolution of Claude Code
Claude Canvas represents a significant shift in how developers interact with AI agents. Created by David, the CEO of Glide Apps, this open-source plugin extends **Claude Code**—Anthropic's terminal-based coding assistant—into a multi-functional personal assistant. By integrating custom UI displays directly into the terminal, users can now perform tasks like email drafting and travel planning without leaving their command-line environment.

### Technical Architecture and UI Rendering
The tool operates by triggering specific "skills" based on user prompts. Currently, there are three primary skills: flight, document, and calendar. When a user requests a task, Claude runs a **Type

Script** file using **Bun**. The interface is rendered using **Ink**, a React library specifically designed for building interactive command-line interfaces. To display these interfaces alongside the terminal chat, the plugin utilizes **T-mux** to spawn split panes.

While T-mux is currently the standard for team sessions, the community has already developed forks for native **i

Term** and **Apple Terminal** panes. The most critical technical feature is **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**. This allows the split pane to communicate back to Claude Code. For example, if a user selects a specific flight or seat in the UI pane using arrow keys or the spacebar, that information is fed back to the AI agent to complete the workflow.

### Practical Applications and Simulations
The demonstration highlights two primary use cases. First, an email previewer allows users to see a formatted version of a message with "From," "To," and "Subject" fields clearly defined before sending. Second, a sophisticated flight booking interface displays various flight options, price points, and an interactive seat map. In the flight demo, users can navigate options with arrow keys and select seats dynamically.

It is important to note that currently, much of this data is simulated for demonstration. However, the potential is vast: connecting these tools to **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** servers would allow the AI to pull real-time data from Gmail or travel APIs. This would transform the interface from a visual mockup into a functional tool for executing real-world transactions directly from the developer's terminal.

## Context

This development highlights the growing trend of "agentic" workflows where AI does more than just generate text; it interacts with external systems and user interfaces. As developers increasingly adopt AI coding assistants like Claude Code, there is a natural push to centralize other daily tasks within the same environment. By leveraging open-source tools like **Ink** and **Bun**, the community is building a bridge between traditional command-line efficiency and the visual richness of modern applications. This is particularly relevant for power users who want to automate administrative tasks while maintaining the speed and control of a terminal-based setup, reflecting a broader trend of the terminal evolving into a primary operating hub for personal and professional life.
