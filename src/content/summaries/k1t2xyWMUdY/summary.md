  title: "How METR measures Long Tasks and Experienced Open Source Dev Productivity - Joel Becker, METR"
  description: "AI models are crushing benchmarks. SWE-bench scores are climbing, and METR's measured time horizons are rising rapidly. Yet when we deployed these same models in a field study with experienced developers, they didn't speed up work. What's going on? Are benchmarks misleading us about AI capabilities? Are we missing something about how AI performs in the real world? In this talk, we'll reconcile lab and field evidence on AI capabilities. Drawing from METR's time horizon measurements and developer productivity RCT, we'll explore why impressive benchmark performance doesn't always translate to real-world impact. We'll examine potential explanations—from reliability requirements to task distribution to capability elicitation—and discuss what this means for automated AI R&D.

## Key Takeaways

Joel Becker discusses METR's research on measuring AI's real-world impact on developer productivity and forecasting capability growth. Key insights include:

*   **AI can slow down expert developers:** In a controlled study with 16 experienced open-source developers, those using AI assistants like Cursor took *longer* to complete tasks than those without, primarily because maintaining high-quality, maintainable code requires extensive human verification and cleanup of AI output.

*   **Time horizon is a key metric for forecasting:** METR tracks the **'time horizon'**—the longest task duration an AI can successfully complete—which has followed a predictable, log-linear growth curve. A slowdown in compute growth could significantly delay projected AI capability milestones.

*   **Real-world performance diverges from benchmarks:** AI excels at narrow, benchmark-style tasks but struggles with the **'fuzzy goals'** and complex, undocumented legacy systems common in real-world R&D, data science, and enterprise environments.

*   **Generalizing productivity studies is difficult:** Results are context-dependent. Studies in mature open-source projects (focused on maintainability) differ from greenfield or corporate settings (focused on shipping features). The **'J-curve'** of initial slowdown when adopting new tools is a recognized but hard-to-quantify factor.

*   **Future research looks beyond coding:** To better gauge AI's potential to automate R&D, METR is interested in studying its impact in domains like mathematical research, law, and data science, where success relies less on code and more on conceptual reasoning and navigating messy, proprietary data.

*   **Safety monitoring may limit effective capabilities:** Even if raw capability (time horizon) increases, stringent **safety controls** and monitoring (e.g., other models evaluating outputs) could drastically reduce the *effective* time horizon for dangerous tasks, buying more safety runway.

## Summary

### Introduction and Core Argument
Joel Becker from METR presents a nuanced view of AI's practical impact, arguing that to understand its potential for automating R&D, we must look beyond benchmarks to real-world performance. He introduces METR's research methodology, which focuses on measuring what AI can actually *do* over extended periods—a metric called **'time horizon'**—and conducting randomized controlled trials on developer productivity.

### The Developer Productivity Study: A Surprising Slowdown
The core of the talk details a study where 16 experienced open-source developers were randomly assigned to complete Git

Hub issues either with or without AI assistance (using Cursor). Contrary to hype and developer self-reports, the **AI-assisted group was slower**. Becker explains this stems from the high-quality standards of mature open-source projects. Developers must not only verify AI output for correctness but also ensure it aligns with project conventions and long-term maintainability—a process often more time-consuming than writing the code from scratch. The median time spent on post-review code changes was zero minutes, underscoring the pressure for 'perfect' first submissions.

Becker addresses potential confounders like a **'J-curve'** learning effect. While plausible, analysis of the small sample showed no clear correlation between prior Cursor experience and task speed. He contrasts this with studies from large tech companies (like Meta) that might show different patterns due to different incentives (shipping features vs. maintaining code).

### Forecasting with Time Horizon and Compute Constraints
A major focus is using the **time horizon** metric—the maximum duration of a task an AI can successfully complete—to forecast capability growth. This metric has followed a steady, log-linear doubling trend. Becker argues that if this trend is causally linked to compute growth, a potential future slowdown in compute expansion (due to physical or economic constraints) would dramatically delay projected AI milestones. This forms a key model for predicting the timeline of advanced capabilities.

### The Gap Between Benchmarks and Real-World Tasks
Becker emphasizes that AI's strong benchmark performance doesn't translate directly to real-world utility. He highlights domains where AI currently fails:

*   **Enterprise Data Science:** Navigating contradictory, undocumented legacy data schemas at companies like Linked

In requires understanding tribal knowledge that isn't in training data.

*   **'Fuzzy Goal' Achievement:** Projects like **AI Village**, where agents try to organize events or run stores, reveal that AIs struggle with open-ended, multi-step tasks in simulated worlds, partly because the world is built for human cognition.

*   **Specialized Domains:** Fields like law (discovery) or chip fabrication involve complex, legacy processes where iteration is slow and human expertise is deeply embedded.

### Future Research Directions and Safety Considerations
METR is exploring new research avenues to triangulate AI's true capabilities:
1.  Analyzing **in-the-wild transcripts** of AI coding assistants to see how they perform on real, messy problems.
2.  Studying performance in **non-software domains** like mathematical research to reduce the advantage AIs get from vast public code training data.
3.  Investigating how **safety monitoring** (e.g., using one model to watch another) could reduce the *effective* time horizon for dangerous tasks, potentially adding a layer of safety even as raw capabilities grow.

Becker concludes with a discussion on robotics and **'hardware bottlenecks,'** questioning whether a 'software-only' singularity is possible or if automating AI research fully also requires automating chip design and physical production—a potentially much slower process.

## Context

Joel Becker is a researcher at METR (formerly known as the Machine Intelligence Research Institute), an organization focused on understanding and forecasting AI capabilities, particularly concerning safety and long-term impacts. This talk was given at the **AI Engineer** summit, a venue for practitioners building with AI. The discussion contributes to the critical, ongoing debate about **AI's real-world economic impact** and **capability forecasting**, moving past hype to examine empirical evidence. It's highly relevant as companies invest billions in AI tools promising developer productivity boosts, while safety researchers grapple with timelines for advanced AI. This video is essential for AI engineers, product managers, tech leads, and policy researchers who need a data-driven, skeptical perspective on current AI limitations and future trajectories.
