  "fullText": "here's the very simple argument. If you look at the sub notion of compute over time um you know this could be like R&D um spending on compute this could be experimental comput it could be training compute what you know whatever um that some particular lab is is using goes like this no surprise if you have another chart of like um you know log time horizon let's say this this uh meter measure from the um this figure that many of you would have seen on Twitter over time it looks like um uh you know let let's say that this was like not merely a coincidence but these things were causally proportional in the sense that if uh if compute growth were to half then time horizon growth were to half. So you know for the for the sake of argument let's say that you know starting from 28 or so um the compute curve begins to bend like that where this would be no growth and this would be the original growth something something like half then if you know if they were causally related and in particular they were causally proportional to one another then you'd expect this to go like that and then for some milestone that you care about let's say here we've got uh one work one work rising up there one month then the delay implied in AI capabilities is potentially enormous. Um now like why you know lots of people have stipulated that there might be some slowdown in comput growth I'm not an expert in in those forecasts but I think I think the prior reasons do seem like somewhat strong to me. One is like physical constraints that we might we might hit power constraints as you mentioned or um there are various other ones that that EPO have a report on that they that they consider all of which seem to not bite through 2030 but you know potentially potentially could bite sometime after 2030. Um I I think the more likely one is just like dollars is a constraint like you can't um you know large tech companies can only spend so much at a certain point like large nation states can only spend so much like you can't um uh I guess there are some scenarios in which you you can you can continue going but that seems to to kind of naturally imply this slowing down and then the you know additional point that this this paper is trying to make is that under a very contestable but standard assumption from economics um you should in fact expect these these two to be causally proportional um I think in particular you should expect them to be causally proportional um to the extent that or for the period that uh software only singularity is not possible and that's a whole another discussion we can talk about that um but at least in this kind of somewhat business as usual um um uh scenario or sort of until that scenario no longer applies um I I think this is this is maybe a reasonable model and does imply some sorting of air capabilities in the in the near future I I have no plan for this session whatsoever >> that also tells us we don't have a technological advance that dramatically improves capabilities relative to like like an unpredictable technological advance, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, all all predictions, you know, assume no unpredictable um Yeah. I'm like um uh you know, time horizon or or like in general in in AI kind of straight lines on on log linear plots um have have been a I think you know, a very highly underrated um forecasting tool. They've done extremely well over now many orders of magnitude. you know, I I think it's reasonable to have the default expectation that the um log linear lines continue through like approximately the same number of orders of magnitude except maybe if there's, you know, some significant break in the inputs. Yeah, of course on the upside there could be um there could be something quite dramatic. Software singularity is the first thing that comes to my mind, but um uh but you know, another Transformer style moment seems like another another candidate naturally. Of course, also one of the problems with with testing this will be that like I think most of the tasks that you have able to test will eclipse the maximum possible amount of time that those tasks could take at some point in the evaluation set. >> Yeah. So I think um you know there are some ways around this that we're working on. I'd be I'd be excited to talk about that. They all feel pretty early. Um uh but uh yeah, you know, I I think it's I think it's right that um if uh if time horizons are doubling, you know, eventually you you know, the um the doubling time is such that you can't possibly make long enough tasks in the in the relevant. >> It's possible also that like we actually hit a place where time horizon is no longer a useful measure because actually you now want time now you want total time to decrease like like like what you want is you want the same result at a lower time. >> Oh. Um uh one >> you want higher reliability at a lower time time horizon. One thing to say about time horizon um is there's like two notions of time here like like a human time axis thing like calendar time access the the time that the model working for I think you should like kind of approximate as zero um it's it's not actually zero they are they are taking actions but they they largely um do their successful work pretty pretty early on to the extent they're going to be successful on tasks um so so my my guess would be that it will continue to be the case that there's not sort so much extra juice on that margin of of making the models complete tasks more quickly although reliability very much so obviously um >> so most of it's like the human like the the iteration loop most of the time is spent in like the human machine iteration loop >> um the humans are working without AIs and the AI working without humans so the for the humans I guess all humans like yeah Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Cool. Any questions on me to work? I I can go through um uh some like upcoming things that we're that we're excited about if people are excited about those things. >> Yeah. I I I just have one question perceived one like like the time perception. Yeah. One of the >> Yeah. Yeah. Y >> um one one thing I thought and you you brought up a little bit in the paper which is uh you know whether or not familiarity is a confounding factor. Um although one of the things >> with with tools you think >> yeah tool is kind of factor and and of course also like you also brought up that like tool capability has dramatically changed but uh there was an interesting presentation from meta at the developer activity engineering summit this year >> and they had done us they have probably the best infrastructure for quantitative measurement of like developer experience in the world of any company >> and they're able to tell you basically how long it actually takes to make uh make a PR basically they call it the opposite meta but like how actual effort like human time effort it took to make a PR and what they saw was they saw a J curve when they gave people agents and that J curve was I don't remember how long it was like three months or six months and so one of the things I also wonder is like if it would be interesting if if there's a cut off of how much familiarity the person has like have they been using this as their full-time daily driver for a period of months uh and if there's like a cut off that occurs once their like certain level of familiarity occurs Yeah, I I I'm totally I'm totally on board with like not just in this case, but in many economically relevant outside of software engineering cases, you know, JC like explanations being being a real thing. I'm like, yeah, um uh you know, developers, not just developers, um experiment with tools. You know, you tend to be slower the first time that you're experimenting with tools. um uh but you know if if you're doing this so that you you have some investment benefits you know later on you might be might be more proficient at the tools or in the case of AI um maybe you just sort of expect the models will get better and so even if you don't become more proficient it will be like the kind of thing that you want to do you know those explanations broadly um make sense to me um um I can give you some reasons why I have scores um I think so one thing to say is you know we're Um um what are some things to say? Um uh as backgrounds, you know, we're continuing with this with this work and we'll we'll see. Um uh you know, another thing to say is just like quantitatively, you know, difference between this and this very large. I'm like how much how much is Jacob explaining? I think it's not explaining that much. Let me explain that because like we see this over and over actually in software engineering studies that the one question you can't ask people in a survey is how long did a task take time >> like you can ask people how much more productive did you feel and they will give you an accurate response that correlates to quantitative feedback. >> Ask anybody the amount of time that something takes they are almost always wrong. So that I was like like what when I share this with my colleagues I was like okay I'm not surprised about that at all but what is interesting is how much is the slowdown aspect that was what was >> yeah yeah yeah that um uh yeah uh point well taken that that that makes a lot of sense I do I do um uh so I think we despite this were interested in time estimates because um you know we're we're interested in providing >> yeah I mean the perceptual like I do think that's relevant too also because like the perceptual aspect also the hype aspect >> right like so developers will tell you that they were faster when they weren't and I think that is worth knowing >> and you know to to the extent that we're interested in um uh measuring the you know possibility timing nature of um of capabilities explosions or sort of aird being automated one commonly proposed measure to do this is just like ask developers or researchers how much they're being sped up and for exactly the reasons they're pointing at I don't put a lot of faith in those um in those in those estimates. So nice to nice nice to see it like this. Yeah. Some some more some more Jacob things. So I so the so the forecasters who who are not predicting time to complete right they are they are just predicting this this effect size that non-developers the expert forecasters they are told the degree of experience these developers have and some of the forecasters are um in thinking about how this population might be different to other populations pointing out various facts about the study like they're more experienced I expect experienced people to get less um uh to get less speed up or you know repositories are larger. I think AIS are less capable at working on large repositories. I expect less speed up. They never never mention um familiarity with tools. My my sense is that um yeah, they share the the sense that I had ahead of time, which was like most of the action is in understanding what AI's the kind of things that AIs are good at or bad at in the first place. And all of these developers have experience with LMS and their core development workflow. It's just cursor that they're they're quite that three course of them are totally unfamiliar with at the start of the study. Um so I I just I wasn't seeing much much margin. Um yeah I I I think I think it is I think it is an open open question. I I also you know we watched so many hours of screen recordings of these developers working and um I just do not see um I think they're like prompting very reasonably you know in some cases worse than me and my colleagues in some cases better. Um I I'm not seeing these like advanced workflows that they're not accessing. >> Yeah. And my experience is is not that far off from this is that there are times when like I am dramatically slowed down and there's times when I am accelerated. >> Yep. >> And although as my familiarity with the tool increases. >> Yeah. >> I definitely improve a lot because I learn over time >> what I can tell it to do and what I can't tell it to do. >> Yeah. >> In addition to like it's just getting better with it like understanding like okay now I need to plan blah blah blah blah. But I but that's why so the thing is like before you make a like high level architectural decision that you know 10 conversations uh 10 conversation uh turns down is going to blow up in your face you like really try and think about it. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And and and also like scope it down to like a smaller problem. Like I at first I would try problems that were too large and like can't handle that. >> But just I mean just for the future if you ever do I mean I think it's obviously really hard with the with the sample with the 16 person sample size. But >> that's great great because because in the future what I I think having a cut off like trying to figure out if there is a cut off of familiarity where the number changes would be interesting to see if that meta result generalizes outside of >> um we are we are on it I think. Um the AIS have been getting better during this period which is going to compound a lot of a lot of what's going on obviously but uh yeah yeah >> the thing is the projects themselves are very optimized for people coming on to new projects and figuring out how to you know they're already the ones that struggle to be organized well for humans to come on board and be able to navigate them quickly don't survive very long in the open source ecosystem and these are fairly mature open source projects. They're a little bit different from like in enterprise settings where things survive because they make money even if they're a pain to develop on, right? So the the context is a bit different. >> These are the repos. Yeah. Yeah, that that is a really interesting point because like actually some of the repos that I was helped the most with were ones that I was completely unfamiliar with and which had no decent documentation of any kind and where like I I had to come in on this legacy code base that had existed for years and like make a change and and like the developer who owned it was like only partially available to answer questions to me and so in that case like cloud code was a huge help. >> Yeah. Legacy code bases don't exist because they work well. It's because they make money. >> Yeah. question I had was um sort of like did all the developers have the same level of AI familiarity with cursor or was was there some variance and was that like is there a plot of like each of each each of their familiarity >> there's always a plot >> there's always a plot that could kind of like dig into like the question of oh is there is there a J curve >> yeah so so here's some here's some evidence Um, so okay, the you know, I can show you some plots. I think the the the sample size is just small enough that like you shouldn't really believe any of the I mean I think the plots aren't going to show much, but then I I don't want to say that's like strong evidence this is not something that's going on. I just think the evidence is kind of weak. The thing that really convinces me is like watch the videos. Obviously videos working and you know often they're better at using cursor than me and I'm like well you know I'm I'm working on this project using cursor. Um but but here are some graphs. So um so this is by whether they have various types of um uh AI experience coming into the study and you know basically you see no movement in in point estimates people for whom cursor was a primary ID before um yeah not not a huge amount of difference versus people for whom it was not. Um then the next one is you know you might think may maybe you have a view that you know some Jacob cut off comes after this point but still you know within the within the study there's some variation in how experienced people are with AI because they have multiple issues you know after the first AI issue they're slightly more exposed than after the second AI issue. So you might try sort of excluding those data points over time and and seeing and seeing what pops up and you know they don't they don't seem to get better at using error over time. >> Although I think there's probably a static issue with that. >> You think there's probably what? Sorry. >> Yeah, there's probably a static issue with that that plot right there. Like those bars are very very wise. >> Oh, I mean I think yeah none I I think like all of the um plots outside of the main plots all of these subsets things you should like not put a lot of stock in. Um yeah, I I I I totally I totally agree. Um okay. And then lots lots has been made so so this graph is the reason we put it in unclear evidence because we're like ah things point in different directions. Um a lot has been made of of this plot suggesting you know something something J-shaped in particular that you know at the end once people have more experience um uh they do experience some some speed up. Um here are some issues. You know first like the other plots don't I think that's important to to include. Second, these hours are coded very conservatively. So for instance, someone in the 30 to 50 hours bucket is um had cursor as their primary IDE in 2024, they had recorded themselves on their time tracking software as having spent 140 hours using cursor. They conservatively estimated that they'd spent 50 hours using cursor. And so they end up in our 30 to 50 hours bin. This is someone whose whose primary ID was was was cursed last year. Um, and and you know, people have been commenting about this. They've been using cursor for less than a week. I think that's not a not a very fair assessment. If you if you were to move that developer over from the uh penultimate bar into the again, you shouldn't believe this because of statistics, but um if you were to move the uh that that developer from the um penultimate um effect size estimate to the to the last one, then you see some balancing out where you get back to essentially zero in the last bucket. Yeah. Again, so so like transfinitive. I think Jacob explanations, you know, still like very on the table. >> Is is it not likely though that the 50-hour group also is similarly underestimating their their time they've spent using cursor and that actually if you just had a longer scale that you would still see a degree >> Oh, that that is an interesting point. Um um that seems plausible to me. Um and then and then I guess I want to I'm not sure it's underestimate because we're using this like very conservative >> Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Um, yeah. Yeah, I think that seems plausal to me. And then, um, for this not to be strong evidence, I'd retreat back to I think you shouldn't really believe in any of these. >> Yeah. I think the biggest thing is it's small sample size and there's also a lot of bias in the data set effectively, right? Like it's a certain kind of data set. It's open source. >> You mean like the kinds of the kinds of developers? >> Yeah. Open source developers and also working on open source projects that are pretty mature. >> Yeah. you know those those two things are if you're working with open source developers are pretty mature this is probably reasonably indicative maybe but the sample size is pretty small but outside of that it gets a little harder >> yeah and talks about this I'm like um uh I think yeah this group is really weird it's really interesting it's like interesting for the same reason it's weird right um uh yeah we we were interested in you know again studying um uh possible effects on of AI for R&D speed up or or or automation. Um there if any types of developers are not being greatly sped up, it implies the whole thing isn't isn't being sped up. So So it is kind of curious to see even even like particular weird populations. You might imagine in like large, you know, sort of production inference code bases maybe have a bit more of this shape than scrappy experiment scripts. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Um but yeah, it's totally >> No, I think I think it's very interesting. It's just it's hard to generalize. We just don't know. >> Yeah. Yeah, we are doing this large study and I think you know I think unfortunately after the large study which includes more green field projects I think it's still going to be hard to um for for not so similar reasons. Yeah. >> Although I don't feel like your results are particularly contradictory with any actual independent research that's been conducted. The only research that I've seen that I would say is contradictory to yours is research that has been funded by model shops or agent shops. >> Um what can I say about that? I I do I do think that most of the research that's that's put out um is associated with uh large tech companies um and I and I think there are other methological concerns that I studies as well. >> I I have methodological concern with that as well. I know people who work at some of those places have methological concerns with the work that was output. So >> I mean I you know I think I think there there are concerns about also. >> Sure. Sure. But I I actually feel like I I remember somebody sent me your paper and when I saw the headline I was like no way. >> Well, me too. >> I was like that sounds like BS. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> I read the paper and I was like, >> \"Oh, this doesn't suck at all.\" >> Like a little bit. >> Well, no. Like at at least your high level conclusion both is intuitive like from a person who's read a lot of software engineering research and also is well justified. I like I think people I have had people argue with me about the 16 developer thing, but I don't think that actually matters in that particular case because I think they're actually a fairly good control set more or less, right, for an experiment because they they remove a lot of validity concerns by being experts. So yeah, they it's true that they don't represent certain like like the broad aspects of developers, but they also remove a lot of variance and what you would expect from the population and they and they allow you to have like a sort of an epistemological function of like hey let's isolate that factor away and then that's let's see what happens with that and that's I like that and then they thought the way the study was conducted was completely sufficient to draw a conclusion a high level conclusion that it draw. >> Thank you very much. Um here's a here's a curiosity. So so we did we haven't published this because of organizational reasons that I won't go into but um we did um we did conduct this um uh you know people would throw sort of their various explanations for for for what's going on here you know many of which have lots of merit some of which more more skeptical of um you know a natural one is brownfield versus greenfield projects. Um so we ran this um kind of enormous hackathon where we randomized half of teams to um use AI versus not kind of you know maximally green field or something. Um and uh and then we'd have a bunch of judges score them um you know many judge scores per project or something to try and even out that noise and we'll see you know is it the case that like the bottom uh 50% are all the AI disloud group and the top um the top are all the um AI allowed groups or something like that. Now, unfortunately, it was sort of even even smaller. That's like part of the reason we're not publishing this. I think the evidence is is is really quite weak. The degree of overlap is enormous. Like the the point estimate that we um I'm a bit nervous about saying this because, you know, hasn't gone through the kind of review processes that something like this goes through. So, so um maybe I messed something up, but um uh I think the point estimate is something like four percentage points higher on a on a sorry, four percentile points higher um if AI is allowed versus if it's not after after controlling for everything else. That is like you know extremely noisy and you shouldn't draw any conclusions but um but seemingly maybe kind of um small effects from AI. Um yeah. Yeah. >> So one question I have I guess this is related to the study and also related to other research that you guys have done. Um so have you found a similar pattern or I guess first have you um explored like the effect of AI in other domains and specifically software engineering? Um and if so have you also found this kind of surprising result that maybe speed up? Um um no no no no I mean not new directions ones um stuff that we have not done um uh yeah I yeah you know we're interested in understanding um uh possibility of accelerating R&D um you know coding is not the only kind of thing that happens at major AI companies much more conceptual work happens um uh you know I'd be I'd be very excited about um um you know working with math PhD students or very different types of software developers or um or you know running running these kind of studies inside of um major AI companies or or large tech companies or or something like that. I think um we are very interested in you know not necessarily directly but some somewhat close analogy to um to the large air company case. So to the extent that something really deviates from that um probably less interested. >> Interesting. So yeah. So I guess it sounds like uh you're interested in measuring capabilities for like math research um and uh some other research. >> Yeah, I I'd say I'm interested in like what the hell is going on in AI and um you know how am I going to learn the most about what the hell is going on in AI? Um, you know, I I think something something a bit more conceptual, some something where, you know, fewer humans are currently working on it, so it's less appearing in training data, um, will help me better sort of triangulate the truth about what's going on in AI, um, even if I don't care about math research in particular, um, it'll still sort of draw helpful qualitative lessons is kind of the sense I have. >> Yeah. I mean, if I was going to pick the areas that I think it's most successful in or like the areas where I would expect to be more successful, but where I think it is being less successful, I would pick probably data science >> as an interesting one like how does data science how a bunch of data scientists help by AI today. >> Say more about what you expected to be less successful. >> Um, so in a in a real so let me give you an example. >> Yeah, Google LinkedIn >> and at LinkedIn there are 5,000 tables with the name impressions in the in the table, right? So if an analyst wants to understand how many impressions happened on a page, where the hell do they go? Hum being can't figure that out. >> Yeah. >> Like today, there is no existing AI system that we have that can be hooked into like corporate environment like that and process through I mean there's trillions of rows in those tables. So like how like like so what a data scientist needs to do is they need to be like I need to like you know analyze a bunch of data and come to a conclusion, right? Uh and I I hear lots of like thoughts about building systems. You know, people talk talked about ML to SQL. The models are much better writing SQL than they used to be. But I believe that the state of underlying data is so bad that the the the actual data scientist going to get way less value out of the the AI than software engineers are mixing for. >> That is >> interesting. >> That's very curious. I um so one one view that some some more bearish people have looking looking at the future of AI is is um you know so much there's so much classic knowledge around there's so much knowledge that's sort of um embedded inside of companies that you're you're not going to pick up from you know these like RL training environment startups or or something something something you know maybe it it's not sort of the state of nature that there needs to be many specialized AIS the like much of the lesson of the past few years is that one big general AI seems to seems to be more performance but you know at some point in the future when data is like locked up inside of companies um uh you know we will have more of this um uh proliferation of of many more specialist models as I have you know GPTN fine-tuned on on LinkedIn data in particular something something something I have one reaction that's kind of like that >> yeah I don't know >> I do have a disbelief like reaction I'm like ah science you know >> but also like so but also like so contradictory facts so one of these problems is the all these data sets contain contradictory prefax like the name of the field will be uh like uh you know date started or like it'll be time started right and then it will contain only a date except for it will only contain the date up until like November of last year and then after that it will contain only the month but then after that it'll contain maybe the the seconds that the thing finished and in order to actually successfully query the data set you the data an you the data analyst or the data scientist have to know what those cuto off dates were not written anywhere Although what you could do theoretically is import a bunch of the SQL that other analysts have written to try to figure out like how they triangulated these things and work backwards from those reports. But today though I think today for example >> people sorry I've just like I haven't worked large company people don't fix this source. >> Oh no. So >> I feel like the lesson I learned over and over again at this data specs really matter really matter. No, I I I've also been working in data analysis and research developer research >> and yeah >> and so yeah so the like the problem is like their job is like produce this report for this executive right not go make infrastructure to produce this report for this >> but I'm like if I okay >> I'm with you I live that dream every day yeah you just have you end up having to right is is you have to build out infrastructure for it that has to be part of the job description And and the other part is you have to fix the problem at the source. Like you really I I I still remember having a conversation where where someone said it's too difficult to fix it at the source because there's too much complexity of all the systems that depend on the source. And I said okay wait a minute you're saying it's too complicated to solve at the source downstream somehow a problem that is too big for the entire organization to solve. >> It's easier to solve there. Come on. Like that doesn't make any sense. I just think there's so much potential here and I have not seen a lot of studies done on like how people who are working in that data space are experiencing AI and what's fascinating about that is real ML is mostly data work like like ML especially outside of LLM outside of LLMs the majority of ML engineers spend most of their time doing like feature curation >> rather than they spend actual direct model training >> and like trying to clean up bad data for feature curation. So like theoretically the potential even for the improvement of ML by enabling ML to be a better data scientist is huge and I I suspect that if you my hypothesis is if you went into this space you would discover it is great at telling me how to write SQL or how to like write pandas and or polars or whatever you're using. It is okay at doing very trivial things and it fails at all complex tasks like fails completely at all complex tasks. I don't even know. I haven't even set a benchmark on it. >> Can you give me an example of a of a a complex task? >> Sure. Um uh let's say a complex task is determine the time between uh give me the P90 of time between deployments for all deployments that happened to Capital One. >> It struggled at that. >> Yeah, that that it doesn't seem surprising to me. >> That seems surprising, right? >> Yeah. Uh so uh >> and like you know if it has sort of reasonable context about where it would find this >> kind of data right sure makes sense and uh and and then so okay so fine so so give me that number and then also I make sure that you can break that down you know by team hierarchy so you give me that in a table so I can break it down by team hierarchy >> uh where is the team hierarchy data like uh how oh here's a funny thing uh what PRs were in those so how do I know how How would I how do I actually determine what the time deployment started and ended was? Because it turns out that's not clear in the base telemetry. And you have to like know magic to figure out when the when the deployments started and ended. Um uh oh, and also tell me, you know, for my ability to analyze it, tell me how many PRs were in each of those deployments and which PRs went to each of those deployments. Well, guess what? The deployment system only, this isn't being recorded, right? >> I think it is being recorded. >> Okay. >> Yes. But before you >> um so then you know imagine the public system doesn't contain sufficient information about that data right uh then like like where do I get that data well that data it doesn't exist in any other system so what I well maybe I have to go like I have to go to GitHub and I have to call the GitHub API and like the chance of the LM or any agent figuring that out today is pretty minimal. Hm. Yeah, I do still, you know, relative to my colleagues, I'm I'm I'm pretty bearish on AI progress. I I I do still have some reaction that's like, ah, like can't you spend a day getting this into a cursor rules file, you know, like where where the where the hierarchy exists. >> I I would I would go I think that's why I think it's interesting. I think it would be worth studying. I don't I have not seen any real comprehensive study on the experience that data scientists have. Um um if you if you have any ins to um uh to to us running studies at large tech companies then I I am all in. >> The only there there is a fellow at open eye that I was talking to who's one of the speakers who does evals internal evals and he has mentioned that he's done some work with data scientists. So he might know some people who have that data but it's it's all been internal between him and like ser between him and like you know entropic or whatever right. Um and yeah that and I also think uh I one of the ones I'm curious about too is lawyers curious about like more traditional like older like um lawyers doctors and I think mathematicians are all really interesting to me >> just because you know both lawyers and doctors are so constrained by a legacy history of like the constraints around them and how they work >> and yeah legal legal issues I'm imagining continue to be a significant bar. >> Yeah. And they're stood like I I I'm also interested in like what's the how are the >> stodgginess I feel like is is a um I I think I'm less bought into as a long-term explanation for economic I like the the legal restrictions they sort of continue to be the case through time. The stodgginess I can like set up a new law firm that's less stodgy and then take the previous law firm or seems to >> I agree. I I don't think it's persistent. I just think it's it's interesting to see one thing that would be interesting to see is like if that affects the mental model that they have today like like if if they're like how they've been talked to about it or how their trust in it affects how they use it. >> It would be interesting to know to me like I don't know it's a worthwhile study. It's more like one of those things that I wonder about idally. You take a lawyer who just got out of college and sort of, you know, has spent a lot more time using CHTPT. And you take a lawyer who's been in the business for 50 years and, you know, has has a a giant folder full of word docs that contain like all the briefs that all their, you know, junior associates have written for decades and decades. And he just opens up those briefs and like changes a few words in them and then sends them out to the judge. And he like, you know, has known those judges for like 30 years, 40 years. He knows exactly what they want. that like you know is he getting any is he going to get any value but is there a value he should get is there something that like is there some way that like he would be helped by AI I certainly know discovery discovery in AI is like in in law is like a huge huge problem and I I know that like there's Harvey I don't know anything about what success they've had a lot of people working in that space specifically like that's it's an ongoing thing right there. There's always technology for it, but it's kind of the adoption of it is a very different thing from >> that's that's that that's the thing, right? Because I one of the first things that I thought of because I I have a little bit of a legal background and one of the first things that I thought of the first time like when Chic 3 came out, I was like, \"Oh, this could totally change discovery.\" Like this could because discovery is like the most painful and most difficult and most expensive. You can have serious social consequences by making discovery less expensive. Like that is the expensive part having a lawsuit. And so like you could actually have significant impact on a society if you could make discovery cheap and instantaneous and reliable. >> Yeah. >> I have a question. >> Yeah. Sorry. Scatter plot, right? >> Um, >> first in 50 hours. Oh, >> I see. Yeah. Yep. Uh, >> I say it's this one. Yes, that one. So, you're saying that people the develop there was no difference cursor. We're talking about the ID that VI coding and they use it for 50 hours. Well, I was very intrigued by that because everyone talks about VI coding and how cursor is instrumental. Why did you get to how did you get to 50 hours? Just curious. >> Um, so so this is including time arrive at 50 hours is >> this is including uh time in the experiments um that developers have spent in the experiments plus their plus their past experience. So for um for for some developers working on some issues as part of the experiment some of them have gotten to more than 50 hours of um cursor experience um uh and that's that's just coded up in that in that bucket at the end. >> And it was was it the same task for each group? Uh, no. These are kind of they're natural tasks that pop up on the GitHub repositories, which which as mentioned are kind of um I don't want to uh I'm a little bit nervous about saying they're weird because it implies they're um uh I want to say it's very interesting and it's very weird and and it's interesting for the same reasons it's weird. the these are um these are repositories in which they have these these are projects in which they have an enormous amount of mental context to build up um that the the AIS might not have um that they've worked on for for many many years that they can um I'm not sure this is always the case but you know I imagine it in my head that they basically know how to execute on the particular task they have before um uh before they even you know go about attempting it because they're so expert in the in the project the positive speed of is it like like 5% like what do you what's how do you quantify the positive speed of >> um so uh you might think about uh let's let's go to this one instead. So um on the here left hand side we have the um averages for what the developers say um will happen in terms of their time to complete if their issue or their task gets assigned to the AI disallowed or the AI allowed group. Um you know they they think that if AI is disallowed it will take them a bit more time closer to two hours and I guess more like an hour and a half or a little bit less if AI is allowed. Um but then you know we we randomize this particular task to allow AI or not allow AI and it turns out you know if we randomize to AI allowed then that the times are more like a bit above 2 hours rather than a bit below 2 hours. Um and then you can think of the uh change in time estimate as sort of being one divided by the other here. It's not quite that for reasons reasons I can go into but it's you know it's effectively um what exactly is the transformation? You know what it's something like AI disallowed over the AI allowed minus one. So, uh, to draw that out, I'm like, um, you know, I might be like, what's what's the speed up? You know, is it like, uh, 1.1x that, but you know, these these developers are going 1.1 times faster when we're actually on a time to complete scale, not a not a speed scale, but ignoring ignoring that um ignoring that detail. Um, you know, is it 1.5x? Um, is it 0.5x? So, they're actually going sort of twice as slow. um how how would we get that information? Well, we'd do something like um take the AI disallowed times divided by the allowed AI times. You know, if this was uh 1.1, let's say, times as long as the allowed times, then we'd get to uh 1.1 x speed up. It's something something like that that's going on. And in fact, you know, we find that we find that slow down. >> I I just read a fascinating article as company I remember, but basically journalist was allowed to um using five coding, right? uh do a pull request, meaning there was some feature and AI was used to assist with building out the requirements and she practically according to the article just kind of did a little couple of tweaks and then just signed off on it. >> It was just really fascinating. That was the whole live coding thing. >> Yeah, I coding like that was the whole thing. It was like you didn't have any software development background. That was all I was just curious. You've tried to do a study on that. >> So I so I definitely do I definitely do the share but you know if you've got like no idea what's going on then um probably probably these are going to be some some significant um some significant speed up. you know I I I will say I guess number one it's not um you know it's not a priority obvious um you know in fact we went out and did this hackathon with you know very experienced people and much less experienced people and and tried to see what happened and what we found is you know the scores the judge scores extremely noisy and I think you shouldn't believe it but um you know the the judge scores were not that much higher when the AI was allowed versus versus when it was not that the people aren't actually making that much more progress and then and then another thing to is I I think there's going to be more expertise in this in this room than than I have. My understanding from you know sitting with these open source developers for a while and not not being a very capable developer myself um is um is that the the quality bar on the repositories in in this study is just very high typically. Um and so I would be very surprised if a journalist um you know even frankly if like a good software engineer without lots of experience on the repository but but certainly you know someone who wasn't a software engineer was able to get up a clean PR on these repositories first time in fact I think that's a lot of the story for what's going on here is that the AIS you know they actually kind of do make progress in the right direction some some good fraction of the time but um for, you know, for various reasons. Sometimes for reasons of correctness, but sometimes for reasons of like, you know, how they've tried to solve the problem and, you know, whether that's the typical way of solving the problem or like how various parts of the project speak to one another. These these kind of considerations, you know, they they haven't properly accounted for that. And so, you know, the humans not only need to spend expensive time verifying, but also like clean up clean up all the stuff. My sense is that someone who didn't have all that experience like basically wouldn't know how to do that step. Um, and so wouldn't be able to submit a clean PR to these repositories. You know, that's it. Like I relative to these people at least, I suck at software development and I I'm getting up, you know, PRs internally all the time and I think they're I think they're worse quality and um, you know, and they're and they're getting over time. They're getting better over time. You know, I do believe that people are coding when they when they wouldn't be able to code. they are submitting, you know, PRs at a lower quality standard when they wouldn't be able to do that at all. Um, but getting getting up these expert level PRs, I I do feel kind of skeptical >> and and that's actually part of what I was getting at is they often get PRs often get rejected by more novice uh folks on these big on these bigger quality projects for no other reason other than the developer ergonomics impact of the PR, right? So the fact that it makes it harder for me to future maintain because because for an open source project almost all the incentive is biased towards making it easier for me to maintain the project right so every time a PR comes in if it doesn't make it easier for me to maintain the project I have a tendency to reject it right uh if it does make it easier to maintain the project then yay I'm into it as a that is unlike what you have in a typical business context right where most important thing actually is to get something done >> right uh because you're you know the fact that that someone's going to have to spend a lot of time maintaining it's almost job security right but for open source it's the opposite it's actually what causes people to leave projects is when it's difficult to maintain right so it is a different bias on what you accept for pull requests >> can you remind me the name of the name of the English gentleman who maintains the school compiler >> um >> Simon no I I can't remember what name recall >> so here's here's one story that that might be relevant um you know bunch of repositories in the study they all have you know broadly these characteristics one of them is the HA hasll compiler famously on the HA hasll compiler um there's like some chance I don't know if it's 50% or 30% or what but there's some chance that if you submit a PR the >> I'm being recorded the >> Simon Simon >> Marlo maybe >> I'm not sure the creator of the HA hasll compiler will come into the comments and argue with you for many many hours much longer than you spent working on the pull request um until um until the PR hits exactly your specifications. Um combine that fact with the remarkable fact I think that the median PR in the study the time they spend working on the code post review is zero minutes. That is the the median PR is like perfect first time around because the professional incentives of these developers are are like that. Now there's a very long tale on one of them. Um on one of them I think literally Simon this gentleman pops up and I'll use the comments for many hours and that that that one's a lot longer. Um but um uh yeah they are they are maintaining this extremely high bar. >> I'm interested in your other upcoming stuff that you had in your talk. >> Yeah let's do it. Um so um yeah so so you know so one thing I what to say um I guess let's let's go in order as I as I think you mentioned um you know if if uh capabilities as measured by time horizon keep keep doubling it does seem very very challenging to keep up with that um in the short term we have a number of directions for um for getting on top of that but uh and I think that will last like through the year but through two years you that seems challenging. Um I think still possible through 3 years I think still seems possible. You know it start starts to get harder and harder. Um anyway in the short term building these building these much longer tasks and ways in which we might get around the problem entirely. For instance um here's one thing that might be somewhat >> you could also raise the accuracy bar. uh you could raise the accuracy bar although um you know we're the reason we're interested in this in the first place is we're like um you know is GT5 existentially dangerous okay and the answer is no I think >> um but like what but like why why do we think the answer is no okay at least I think there are multiple reasons but at least we can say you know GT5 is just like not that good at stuff like you're trying to get it to do you know data science on these on these um columns that have very similar names and it's like not clear exactly the logic that's led to the columns. It's not it's not doing that sort of thing. I'm like, wouldn't you need to do that sort of thing to be not exactly that, but you know, be capable of stuff to be extensionally dangerous and it's not capable of stuff. Um, so, you know, I see that the the AI are failing at these these hard tasks, I'm like, you know, great, whatever. But if, you know, if it's succeeding 90% of the time and not 99% of the time on like very challenging long tasks, then, you know, I think there are there are, you know, other things that we can retreat to and I'm prepared to retreat to those things. But at least the naive the reason it's not extentially dangerous is that it's not capable of stuff I think at least starts to get pushed on as as as an explanation. So here's another possibility for something we could do. So um what if instead of time horizon here we had uh time horizon uh whilst uh being watched very closely and then time. Okay. And then you know maybe the the time horizon whilst not being watched very closely is like this but the time horizon whilst being watched very closely is like this. That is like if um uh uh you know I I I hope that major AI companies have um monitoring setups uh going where you know for example AI are looking over transcripts of of AI performing work to see if anything suspicious is going on. And you know it's not it won't be impossible perhaps I conjecture to to fool those monitors but you know be challenging to to to fool those monitors. So you know maybe you can do you know 40hour tasks without 40hour you know dangerous capability relevant tasks um without any monitoring but only like 2-hour long tasks if you're if you're being watched very very closely >> being watched like if there's another model evaluating the output. This is the kind of thing. Maybe you escalate to humans and >> with them without safety controls. You mean >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Roughly. Yeah. Um and and then you know now now we've bought a load more doublings. We can we can sort of keep keep doing the capability extrapolation thing. That's one of the kinds of things I'm about in addition to creating longer tasks. >> Yeah. I mean I imagine some of the model shops do have like evaluations of capability with and without safety because I'm sure that they're like there's an argument between their researchers and their safety teams. >> Um yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah. Um um >> seem like I have seen something about this but not a lot. >> Yeah. Yeah. Um yep. Um um yeah I I guess I think that um this might be sort of like an especially quantitatively important consideration or um I I expect that it will reduce the effective time horizon by uh by like maybe an order of magnitude or two. Um yeah, I I agree that there's a there are some important senses in which there's not really a difference difference difference in kind. >> Yeah, of course. Then I would also worry that like publishing that encourages people to like focus less on safety or to like try to argue against safety because how it impacts capability. >> Yeah, I think there are lots of landmines in in um in all sorts of safety work, not just not just the >> Oh, of course. >> Um okay, next thing. um you know we have this we have this trend I spoke about this at the beginning but you know we have this trend is it going to continue forever is this is this a fact of the universe or does it you know somehow depend on inputs or what you think about um intelligence explosions or or something like that um trying trying to think about that where's this line uh actually going is um is a is a pretty active area of work also you know the ways in which um this line or or the the particular points don't quite correspond to the thing I care about. So one obvious way is that um you know these these models are being judged according to um you know I think I think the um algorithmic scoring that we use on on mis tasks is is um is importantly sort of more robust or more covering the relevant concerns than might be the case in just sort of sweet benches and unit tests but but it still sort of it still has a lot of the same character. Um there are um you know considerations like being able to build on this work in future outside of the immediate problem um uh uh facing you that that aren't being captured by by meter scoring. And maybe if you did capture that, you know, you'd get something a little bit like going from 50% success to 80% success. You know, you can do hourlong tasks if it doesn't matter whether you can build on the work, but you know, only 30 minutes asks if it does matter whether you can build on the work. bringing bringing these numbers again to to something I care about a little bit more and then yeah projecting out both if there are compute slowdowns um if if we are going to enter some regime where um uh AIS are building AIS and that leads to some sort of steeping of the curve these these kind of considerations that's another thing I'm thinking about um and then capabilities measurement from new angles so here's um you know here's here's one history of meter that I think is not the accepted history and um also probably um not a very accurate history certainly not the most accurate history but but here's one possible telling um you know near the beginning meter has early access to when I wasn't there and I have sort of no internal knowledge of this when meter has early access to GT4 um and there are just sort of Q&A data sets going on everywhere like Elsat data sets or you're like you know can GT4 seems so smart relative to stuff that that went before. Can it do stuff? You know, so you like you tried out some tasks. Can it can it do stuff? And the answer is, you know, it can do some stuff and it can't do other stuff. Um and um and people like, \"Oh, that's cool. You know, you've tried this, you've tried this um neat new kind of thing, getting models to do stuff instead of instead of answering questions.\" And then and then later you're like, \"Well, different models, you know, they come out over time. You know, this model comes out in January, this model comes out in February. Can they do different kinds of stuff?\" If we test them on the same If we test them on the same stuff, then we'll try and think of kind of the most obvious in some ways summary statistic of whether they can do stuff. This like single single um data point or number that reflects whether they can do stuff, the time horizon, plot it over time and see what happens. You're like, oh that's kind of interesting. And then you're like, well, what's the next sort of in some sense kind of dumbest or like most obvious thing you can do? Well, we'll run kind of the most obvious RCT design. We'll like allow AI or not allow AI and then we'll see we'll see what happens and we'll try and you know it'll be it'll be messy. There's lots of um there are lots of methodological problems that that people point out as there are with this work but there are different kinds of problems you know they have different pros and different cons and maybe with these sort of two different things they give two different answers and have two different sets of pros and cons. we can kind of triangulate the truth from that. And then now I'm like, well, can can we pull that rabbit out of the hat one more one more time? Are there or multiple more times? Are there other sources of evidence that have, you know, different pros and cons that I that I won't believe in fully, but they're different pros and cons and they might give different answers and so on and so forth. Um, here are two suggestions, the things I'm curious about at the moment. The first is um in the wild transcripts. So you know agents in cursor in claw code and in whatever other other um products or services um they leave behind traces um traces of their diffs that they've um contributed to code or or disc of their actions and their racing chains and and so on and so forth. Um the traces that they leave in the wild are you know importantly different from this where it's more kind of contained and you know the task is sort of neatly packaged and stuff. This is going to be, you know, like the like the example with the many different columns that are very confusing. This is going to be like whatever real crap shows up in the wild, how to model sound and that. Um, there are important reasons why you shouldn't believe that kind of information. It's it's like not very experimental. It's like hard to know exactly what to make of it, but it does have these important pros that it's like it's more real. It's, you know, the data is enormous. Perhaps um the data on transcripts is enormous. Um, you know, perhaps there's a lot you can learn there. That's that's one thing. And then and then here's another one. There's this um there's this group which you guys should check out called um agent village AI village sorry um where they um they have um a lot of different models or or agents kind of living in this village occasionally talking to humans trying to accomplish um fuzzy goals that are that are set to them basically using computes. They try and do stuff like, you know, organize this event at the park or um uh run a few human subjects experiment or run this merch store, you know, stuff stuff like that that's not so clearly specified. And basically all the time they find that the models fall on their faces and suck. Um and there are lots of reasons not to believe this evidence. You know, here are some of the reasons. Number one, um, it is using computer use and I think computer use is just way worse than CLI based computer use capabilities are considerably worse than CLI based stuff at the moment or text based things in general at the moment and maybe you care more about text based things because that's more relevant to various types of things you care about and also lots of GUI gooey based things um can be converted into text things. Um, it's um, you know that there's all these different models hanging around in the village. I'm like, why why are there so many models? Like, why is there a village instead of just like some big Asian orchestration setup? I don't I don't really understand what's going on there. And um anyway, lots of reasons not to believe it. But on the other hand, it is models doing stuff in the world. It's not benchmark style tasks. It's like trying to accomplish some goal and they can't accomplish even sort of, you know, very basic subsets of the goal. And I feel like that's extremely interesting. And I I wonder if you could get rid of some of the most obvious cons. you know, make this only text based, give them some um uh relevant textbased tools, work a bunch on the elicitation to to make these models sort of more performance, get rid of the less performant models in in the village, so on and so forth. But then try and get them to do these fuzzy goals. Um and you know just observe like where did they mess up like you know they they they they went about step one it went great but then they sort of they became incoherent or they you know went into a strange psychological basin with one of the other models or you know they they weren't able to interact with external services in appropriate way or or figure out their resource use. You know I'd be very interested just kind of qualitatively in what's in what goes on when you do that. Again, keeping in mind that we're interested in um the ability of um at least at the moment, I'm most interested in the ability of AIS to automate R&D and you know, or speaking to why that's not the case at the moment and why that might not be the case in the near future. Some something shaped like this seems like it might be might be kind of might curiously point to to why that's not the case. Not sure exactly what's there, but yeah. And my observation is that they they are effectively neurode divergent individuals, right? And none of our world was not built for that. There's everything that we have they're defined for a human to do. They're shaped and size to humans. Just like you know the military, like you know how big are packs? Well, it's based on how much they think a person can reasonably carry, right? And how much we expect someone to handle for their taxes, that's based on what we think a human can do. And >> wow. and and they're and if you think about neurode diverent individuals they struggle with challenges with the way the world's expectations don't align with them and compared to a neurode diverent individual these you know these intelligence are really really different right and so all of the rough edges where they don't align with our world that's why they needed assistant human assistant in order to accomplish anything real in our world is just too hard uh for them >> currently currently >> they are I think Yeah. Yeah. Someday change, but now they're just hopeless, right? >> I have to get really, really good. Our world will have to change. One of those two things, >> you know. I I agree. I like so strongly share this sense. But, you know, but if you ask me to really pin down like why why exactly is that the case again when they're like, you know, beating all GPQ GPQA experts on these extremely hard science questions and they're, you know, blah blah blah. Like, exactly what how why are they not able to accomplish things in the world? You ever met a neurody divergent individual who wasn't terribly good at something was completely useless at getting through life? >> Yeah. Yeah. They all very good at reading books. >> There's a lot of those people in the world. I >> It's not that surprising. >> Although my my only feeling about AI village is it's like, well, today is the 200th day my car didn't rocket off the Earth and escape velocity and fly to the moon. >> Like that's because you didn't build a rocket yet. >> Yeah. I think there was a lot of talk a year ago about, you know, maybe I'm mischaracterizing, but I thought there was a lot of talk a year ago about comput capabilities being impressive today. >> There was there was a lot of talk about it and yet I have talked to almost nobody who has used them for any practical >> totally totally um yeah but if we if we move this to text only and it seems reasonable to complete text only um uh you know would you still have the rocket concern? No, I would I would >> Well, it depends on what the task was. >> Sure. >> Yeah. Yeah. The kind of thing that you could that a human could do over CLI. So I think this um this relates to the uh the topic talk that earlier today where they talked about how um you know one way to use uh effectively is to give them if you have a task like figure out a way to present the task or transform the task to something that is indistribute you know for the model and I feel like this conversation kind of you know ties in on that like um you know interacting with with Chrome is less in distribution than a CLI. So I I think that could be an interesting area of research is like you know okay if you're interested in exploring like how well can it perform these really open-ended tasks like first I guess creating harnesses and creating an interface that is much more indistribution for them so that way that's you know less of a concern. Yeah, I mean I I think also speaks to the point about quote unquote neurody divergence of models. Um, you know, there's some uh it's not so different from management skill or something giving, you know, giving appropriately scoped tasks to to your to your very talented interns or very talented neurodyiverent interns or something something like that. I do I do think that's right from the sorry to be a you know um uh sorry sorry to be so repetitive from the perspective of capability explosions um and automating R&D you know I think maybe the models will get extremely good at um scoping tasks for themselves such that it's benchmark style or or something like that but you know if they can't do that I'm like well there's a lot of things that aren't that don't look like benchmarks that crop up in the real world and you do need to be able to kind of flexibly work with that if you're to um do something as complicated as automate a major AI company. Um um and you know so so I do I do think it's um yeah I I think it can both be the case that the AIS are incredibly performance um on some particular type of problem or if you make other types of problems more similar in scope or shape to to the type of problem that they're best at and and also that they you know can't flexibly substitute for human workers because that requires you know um yourself setting up the problem in in a way that's appropriate or or not having those constraints yourself. Yeah, it is interesting though just just to your point about new capabilities is thinking of almost another axis on the graph that you have >> because I think there's not just I wonder if there's not just a time horizon issue but there's a a task category or type of work category like like as your example of computer like computer use is one of those examples right like if we think about the capability of computer use versus or capability that would require computer use versus a capability that could become can be accomplished entirely in text. Yeah. So, yeah, sure. But but but like a lot of these are like like almost all these benchmarks are basically text. >> Um yes. Yes. Yes. And indeed, you know, the ones the ones that aren't the ones that require sort of um vision capabilities are are notably lacking. Yeah. I I I um I'm not sure exactly what to what to make of this graph. I think one thing I make is that you one thing I make of it is that um uh you know there probably is maybe not so much variation in in sort of slope or doubling time across task distributions. I think there's only weak evidence for that. But, you know, in in insects or, you know, the base of where we are now, um, yeah, there's there's possibly a great deal of variety, especially on this sort of um, uh, image- like capabilities versus not to mention, but but physical abilities even more, you know. >> Yeah. Right. So, there's Exactly. Like, so I mean, you could even go through senses, right? Like you you could go through like a tactile like like today like they would all score zero. Nothing has tactile. So like it can't tell you anything about anything tactile. >> Um well you know in producing this graph we you know we try and make the models as performance as possible on some held out so you know we try and give them some tactile stuff. >> I'm not sure they perform zero. >> Sure sure we do have some examples. >> Yeah space judgments judgments like that. But um you know we we've obviously seen configure find control and stuff like that with other robotics. It's just I I haven't even I don't even know if anybody maybe somebody has listed out what all of the capabilities that we would expect in the future like if we actually wanted AGI what is the entire list of >> that's a way to start a debate that doesn't end. I think it's Basel Halperin and Arjun Romani hopefully have a paper on this often a small number of months. >> Yeah. And that be to think about where are we at and do all of the capabilities follow the same all the capabilities that we currently measure. Do they follow the same uh log? >> Yeah, it does seem like a reasonable null hypothesis to to you as well as me. I think not not not not certainty. I mean, who knows? Yeah. Yeah. Um, oh, something there was something I wanted to add there. Um, oh, oh, here, yeah, here's another thing I'm thinking about. Not super in a research classy, although kind of. Um, um, so, you know, some people like me are sort of skeptical of of um software only singularity. That is the the the idea that you could automate AI research without also automating um uh chip design and maybe also chip production as well. um that you'd quickly get bottlenecks by by computes because there are only for fixed hardware there only so sort of so many experiments that you can run that that will be that will be um sufficiently productive to to uh to soon progress upwards. But you know even for people like me who are skeptical of that um uh you know you might think that in fact like chip production is going to get automated. you know, the robots like they're they're coming. They can they can do they can do the stuff that humans do and then and then maybe you really do have a fully self-sustaining um uh robots plus AI economy and you know so you uh you have some slow trend from from comput slowing down but then you have sort of a fuming back upwards once once the whole thing is is um is is in a tight loop. Um one interesting debate that I uh heard about recently and would like to think more is um uh you know I think there's in the public discussion there's some sense that you know why why are robotics capabilities lagging um uh lagging LLM like capability so much well it's to do with training data or something something something like that or or maybe it's to do with hardware constraints >> I'm I'm curious if it's not to do with hardware constraints like what what what exactly are these hardware constraints if we put super intelligence inside hypotheical superchargers inside of you know um hardware parts that existed today could it build chip production facilities and I I have no idea because I'm s you know I'm I'm beyond beyond beyond novice but it's not obvious to me what the what the answer is I think it's I think it's kind of plausible I'm not sure you need this like um yeah I'm not sure you need this like very flexible fine motor control in order to do it also I think maybe the fine motor control is there subject to having super intelligence controlling it. >> I mean to be fair like the key aspects of chip production are done. Um, oh, but but I'm also thinking like building the robots and >> yeah, the whole, you know, >> and that's I'll tell you I I have a friend who spent most of his career doing software development, but during COVID started working on manufacturing things like papers and things like that to help people and he found out how hard the manufacturing world is and how slow the iteration process is. >> And it is really like he put it like he he knew it was going to be worse. he didn't understand that it was like next level like an order of magnitude worse and I think that probably like you know we we from our perspective people who don't do it it seems like how bad can it be right it's the the feedback I've had from everybody who actually works in that space is it's way way different that's what I've heard as well I I've only talked a little bit with like people who work in fabs and stuff but I I was surprised when I did talk to them >> of the level of human expertise required yeah >> in order to work at the fabs like a lot of Those jobs are like fairly high paying actually engineering jobs in order to like success >> also the rate of improvement is actually glacial right compared compared to software right >> I think also because it's cost a billion dollars to build a >> f iteration is a huge cost of time money it it's brutal right >> so it's I think that's why it's been hard to get it all the way there is just like give them a couple more centuries maybe they can get it done >> is that really your view centuries centuries >> I do I do I I do think I'm skeptical like you about like how easy some of these tasks are. >> Yeah. >> We think they're easy, but in my experience like >> I I I remember when the self-driving thing came out when people were like pushing that and it was I actually worked in that space for a while and it was like >> I get that we can get really close to it but getting all the way to something that is acceptable is extremely difficult, right? Uh and we underestimate how much work is involved in getting that last little bit done. the first 90% I I knew we could do it with computers like you know 10 years ago pretty much but getting the last bit that everyone's happy with it >> yeah work >> I feel this myself you know I didn't get a driver's license when I was uh because I expected self-driving cars to come um yeah I think I think totally but it hasn't been that long you know and they're expanding to to um to to the entire bay >> they're going to get there I don't think it's going to take >> is is the is the robot economy. Building the chip production is going to take centuries. >> I don't know. I don't know about Well, I I could see that it might take it's it's so part of the trick with self-driving is the economic incentive is moving it along faster, right? And probably the robot building robots kind of thing, but also but like >> yeah, >> you know, where we're at right now is like Ripre is kind of as far along as we got of robots building robots, right? Which is >> Oh. Oh, but I I I feel like, you know, is that is that paying sufficient attention to the chart? GPT2 2019. >> It's so it's so recent, you know, I I I have some This is so This is so >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Um uh nonsensical, but I'm like maybe we're in a sort of GP2 moment. >> No, it's a fair point. I could be wrong. It's just my guess is it's going to take a lot longer than we think. >> At least to be able to do like real mass production. >> Yeah. uh at a scale that that causes the kind of global impact that you're talking about. Yeah. Right. That that's I I think they can already do a great job building one-offs, right? Robots are very good at build doing one-off builds >> at a small scale, but >> it's totally impractical for doing it at a large scale. >> There is um um um So one one fact I think is kind of remarkable is this maybe it's this is that the rate of is it this yeah yeah the rate of compute put to robotics models lags behind um sorry is is is about the same but the levels uh two orders of magnitude difference. Um I I am kind of um curious if that's if that got closed um um uh what we'd what we'd see. It does seem like at least sort of more capable robots are in some sense um very on the table as something that could be the case very soon if this if this not I'm not saying all the way. I'm certainly not saying trip production. It just does seem like there's some sort of data hang. >> Yeah. Yeah. intuitively. >> That's interesting. >> Um also also thinking some sort of um um some like you don't just need to be scaling data. You can also scale parameters use same amount of data you know flexible ways to use compute to to close some gap. >> Interesting. >> Yeah. >> Just give me a very interesting overview of where AI is going into fabrication >> and and what does it say? Oh, so it says so it says there's a lot of areas where right now it's going to help probably pretty dramatically in the near future and a lot of it's been computational aspects. There's a lot of computational aspects that are extremely expensive. Designing like the mass basically the hole that you're using for the laser to get the transistors. >> Um, and like calculating that, how to build it and ensuring that it conforms to the spec that you've written basically is extremely computationally expensive. Um, and there's a lot of opportunity for AI to have it there. Um, and there's also theoretically the possibility for so like chip obviously chip manufacturer is extremely precise but also fragile and the opportunity for an AI to detect parameters that are basically out of whack and leading to failure potential failure in like imaging a wafer uh is could theoretically dramatically improve yield and yield is a big problem in fab in chip manufacturing. Like the reason that you get different speeds out of your CPUs is because they actually just have the one line that produces all those CPUs and some of them come out better and some of them come out worse. And that's why the higher G that's why the higher gigahertz models are more expensive and the lower G like like if you have like your Nvidia like your home GPUs your your 5040 your 5050 your 5060 5090 are all the same chip right >> that just had different quality different tolerance essentially. >> Yeah. Um, but the problem is that uh cut the recording. They're going to kick us out soon, but feel free to continue discussion. >> Yeah, cool. >> You can also hang out here, but I'm just going to",
