  title: "How the best designers tackle complex design challenges"
  description: "Imagine you’re asked to lead the design of a new project. It’s complex, open-ended, and full of interconnected problems…


    How do you attack that ambiguity and get momentum quickly?


    This episode is an attempt to answer that question by unpacking tactics used by designers like:

tldr: "Tackle complex design ambiguity by identifying **eigenquestions**—core questions that unlock multiple downstream answers—and presenting early **straw man** solutions on a **spectrum of extremes**. This strategy moves teams away from \"menu-style\" decision-making toward specific recommendations that force actionable feedback and reveal critical trade-offs."

## Key Takeaways

Designers should move from being passive order-takers to active navigators of ambiguity by utilizing structured frameworks for problem-solving.

* Identify **eigenquestions** (or tipping point questions) at the start of a project to determine which decisions will make all subsequent choices obvious.

* Map design explorations on a **spectrum** between two polar extremes to help stakeholders understand the mental models and trade-offs behind each direction.

* Always present a **clear recommendation** or a "straw man" option to force a reaction, rather than offering a menu of choices that shifts the decision-making burden onto others.

* Use **high-fidelity prototypes** early in the process as a "flashlight" to get realistic feedback, while using the disclaimer "it could look like this" to maintain flexibility.

## Summary

The episode focuses on how top-tier designers at companies like **Figma**, **Meta**, and **Adobe** handle the initial chaos of a complex project. The first step involves exhaustive question-gathering. Jenny Wen, who led the design for **Fig

Jam**, suggests writing down every possible question—from high-level strategy to tiny UI details. The goal is to find the **eigenquestions**: the tipping point questions that, once solved, cause the answers to other questions to fall into place naturally.

### Designing to Discover
A common mistake is waiting for perfect clarity before starting to design. Instead, designers should use the act of designing as a method for finding the answer. Michael Wandeler highlights the importance of the **"ridiculously early hypothesis."** By coming back to stakeholders just one week after a kickoff with a structured narrative and a specific point of view, designers can generate immediate momentum. This forces the team to react to a concrete idea rather than debating abstract concepts for weeks.

### The Spectrum Framework
When presenting multiple concepts, Alex Cornell warns against presenting a "menu" of isolated mocks. This leads to scattered feedback. Instead, designers should anchor their work on a **spectrum**. By painting the edges—creating one version that is extremely utilitarian and another that is over-the-top expressive—designers can help teams visualize the boundaries of the problem space. Most successful solutions land somewhere in the middle, but showing the extremes makes the final choice feel intentional.

### The Importance of Opinion
One of the most critical lessons for senior designers is the necessity of having an **opinion**. Rich Arnold notes that at companies like **Instagram**, designers are expected to make a recommendation rather than just asking "what do you think?" If a designer doesn't have a point of view, they are often told to come back when they do. Using a **straw man** proposal—an option you believe in most, even if it might change—helps the team align on a route through the "cave" of ambiguity. 

### Communication Tactics
Finally, the video emphasizes the importance of storytelling and "wiggle room." Andre Harasimchuk suggests that while high-fidelity work provides the best feedback because it feels real, designers should frame their work with the phrase, **"it could look something like this."** This tiny disclaimer allows the team to align on the high-level strategy and the "map" of the solution without getting bogged down in visual nitpicking before the core direction is solidified.

## Context

This discussion is aimed at product designers and creative leads navigating high-growth tech environments where ambiguity is a constant. As design matures as a discipline, the role has shifted from visual execution to strategic navigation. Understanding how to frame problems through 'eigenquestions' and lead through 'straw man' recommendations is essential for those moving into senior or staff-level roles. These methods are particularly relevant in the era of AI and complex SaaS tools (like Figma and Fig

Jam), where the design space is vast and traditional linear processes often fail to produce timely results.
