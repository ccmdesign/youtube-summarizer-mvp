  AI has changed the speed of cyberattacks. But it hasn’t changed the most
  important variable: people. 


  In this episode of Security Intelligence, panelists Jake Paulson, Stephanie
  Carruthers and Matt Cerny dig into how AI-driven threats—phishing, deepfakes
  and disinformation—are reshaping the cyberthreat landscape. Organizations,
  too, are adopting AI tools to help detect these attacks. 


  But even in the era of AI, people are ultimately our first and last lines of
  defense. And all too often, we don’t give them what they need to succeed. How
  do we help human beings adapt to the increased speed, scale and impact of AI
  threats? 


  The answer, our panel argues, isn’t more checkbox training or prettier slides.
  It’s realistic, immersive training that builds muscle memory, confidence under
  stress and decision-making skills for moments when things don’t go according
  to plan. 

  00:00 - Introduction 

  01:48 - AI phishing, deepfakes and modern social engineering tactics 

  09:19 - Why humans are still the primary attack surface—and the strongest
  defense 

  17:03 - The difference between tabletop exercises and cyber range training 

  22:00 - How immersive simulations prepare teams for real incident response
  pressure 


  Because when AI accelerates attacks, training determines the outcome. 


  All that and more on Security Intelligence.
