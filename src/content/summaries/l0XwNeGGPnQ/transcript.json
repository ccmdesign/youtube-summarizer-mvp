Um, and it's letting them scale because they have so much time on their hands now. >> All that and more on security intelligence. Hello and welcome to Security Intelligence, IBM's weekly cyber security podcast. I'm your host, Matt Kazinski, and today we have a special episode for you. It's a panel discussion on the role of training in responding to AI attacks. Now, here's what I mean by that. Threat actors have adopted new AI tools with all the same enthusiasm as legitimate organizations. In fact, according to IBM's 2025 cost of a databach report, 16% of breaches now involve AI, usually some kind of AI generated fishing or deep fake impersonation. Hackers are intensifying the speed and impact of their attacks. So that means defenders have to do some intensifying of their own. Part of that of course means implementing our own AI solutions. But our real edge over hackers has to come from people. They're the vulnerabilities that attackers target to get in. And they're the ones who can transform security tools from inert tech to powerful weapons against threats. So we need to help people adapt to the era of AI attacks. And we do that with the right training. But what is the right training? What does that mean? To answer that question, I've got a panel of experts here with me. Jake Paulson, deputy head of X-Force, Stephanie Kurthers, global head of Cyber Range, chief people hacker of X-Force, and Matt Cerny, director cyber security at Integra Life Sciences. Thank you so much for joining me today, folks. To uh kick us off, I want to do a little round the horn style question and I want to know from your perspective, what is the biggest change that AI has brought to the cyber threat landscape so far? I'll throw to you first, Matt. What are you seeing out there? >> It's the speed to attack, at least from a cyber security perspective. I think you mentioned, you know, the fishing side of things where it would take a while previously for an individual to kind of craft a fishing um email. I think now with artificial intelligence, the ability to generate a well-crafted no misspellings logos, you know, resembling exactly what um the company would actually use. So that ability for threat actors to really speed to build up a potential attack um and then also launch that attack becomes much broader as well. So their capabilities in terms of the ability to build it and then their capabilities to launch it at a very broad range of individuals, you know, is is kind of where we're seeing things. >> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And it drives with something that I know Stephanie has talked about before, which is, you know, just how fast you can churn out a fishing email now with AI, right? I think you were involved in some research, Stephanie, where it was like what it takes a person two days now takes an AI like 15 minutes or something. You want to you want to talk a little bit more about that and and and and how AI is affecting the cyber threats? Yeah. >> Yeah, absolutely. When I think of AI and how it's kind of changed, you know, the the cyber threat landscape, I think of speed, scale, and polish. And exactly that. If my team is is creating fishing emails for our clients, right? Not not maliciously, with their permission, of course. Um, it could take us up to a couple of days to actually do the research, find, you know, the right people, write the right uh email, get everything, you know, as good as we can get it. But I can turn around and write a couple prompts and the AI can create that for me. So it's really saving attackers a lot of time um and it's letting them scale because they have so much time on their hands now. >> Absolutely. So that speed, scale, and polish I think is a really nice summary of what we're seeing. Jake, anything to add? What are you seeing out there in the cyber threat landscape? >> I really get concerned at the disinformation leading to misinformation, right? It's really as you and Matt talked about you speed to attack, right? Snow talked about you know scaling and polishing right like I get the biggest concern especially if you're a publicly held company or any greater person who exists in the public ecosystem right that that intentional disinformation that then propagates to misinformation right very different but you know very uh naturally uh one is a natural segue to the other and that is really concerning to me >> absolutely so it sounds like overall the kinds of AI attacks that we're seeing are really happening in this like social engineering misinformation disinformation space, right? It's not so much, oh, they're using AI to generate malware or something. It's more like they're using AI to write fishing emails that you can't tell are fishing emails anymore. Does that sound like an accurate summary of what we're seeing? >> I think so. But the one thing I would add to that is it's kind of hard to pinpoint if AI is doing it, right? If you get malware on, you know, sent in an email, it's hard to say, okay, a human wrote this code or AI did. So that's why I think we as humans can see it a lot more from that human standpoint, the social engineering part of it versus the technical, you know, what's on my machine, how did it get here, who did it. So I think until we can start pinpointing those things, it's a little bit harder to to really trace that. >> You know, that makes a lot of sense, right? It it there's the lines are very blurry and and who's to say, you know, what AI is producing and and what people are producing. And that does kind of bring us into, you know, a question that I want to raise here, which is that as we're fighting these AI threats and we're thinking about the impact of AI on on cyber threats, you often hear about this idea of, you know what, we should use AI to combat AI. And that's that's good. I think we all agree that's a good idea. But then what does that mean about the the role of humans in cyber security, right? Where do we fit in in this landscape where attacks are being automated, defenses are being automated? What what are people doing? Um Stephanie, I'll throw it to you first. What are your thoughts on where do people slot in here still? >> Yeah. So, when I think of like using AI for defense, I like to think of it as like a fire alarm, right? Um or fire detector. AI is really good at catching things that humans miss, it's good at at alerting fast, but we still need the humans to actually review those alerts and decide, is it a real fire? Do I need to evacuate or investigate this? So, I think humans still play a big part of it, but AI can be used to speed up things or find things that humans miss. >> Makes sense. Matt, what about you? Any thoughts on where humans fit in in this AI landscape right now? >> Yeah, I think Stephanie raises a good point. I think, you know, the concept of the human of the loop is very important, right? To be able to discern what Jacob is saying in terms of misinformation or, you know, what's real or what's not real. Um the other component I think from the human perspective is artificial intelligence is you know doesn't take away the constant need for basic cyber hygiene and foundational cyber security right so those things ultimately you know very hard to take AI and say hey automatically build me good cyber hygiene or good build me a good foundation you know they're they're a good layer to add on top to do some of the automated detection um and reviews but ultimately I think the humans they're still a real need for good cyber security hygiene and good cyber security foundation to be built in there and then layer on artificial intelligence on top of that along with that human in the loop still to verify what's actually being identified. >> Absolutely. And Jake, your take on on where humans fit into this landscape. >> Bringing a lot of my military background into this, right? It's it's humans are because of we're inconsistent, right? Because we are human by nature, right? We have good days, we have bad days. We're better, we're sharper, we're weaker, we we deteriorate realy in our attention, right? Like we are always going to be the weakest link in a you know when you want to have a when you expect consistency which is security is always a zero fail game. So humans are always the weakest link, right? However, right, humans are also those who have the ability to, you know, most naturally and organically identify something that that feels off. Call it a gut reaction, call it a six sense, right? like we are we architect that into our AI solutions right now ideally we want our AI or our AI solutions will be able to identify anomalous patterns right but humans are still those who bake their own logical and their own reasoning into these AI systems right we should we're trying to create them like our own mind works quite often right so we are still right in theory we still have the keys and we should still be driving the car right telling the car where to go um so I think that's one thing that really comes with me as you know where humans really big role in this. But I think also as you think about like attackers using AI and a lot of attack groups have fingerprints, right? They have profiles, they have consistent behavior that they return to, right? The more you start seeing AI being used by attackers and crowdsourcing a lot of different attack methods, I do start to wonder how much of those fingerprints are going to dissolve. Attackers are going to get more creative and, you know, when it comes to writing their code, right? are crowd sourcing in open sharing uh you know a lot of their TTPs and a lot of how they write their code right I do wonder as you know our ability to identify who attribution is already a difficult game it's already really really hard it's intentionally difficult um I I do wonder how much of our ability to you know to conduct attribution is going to dissolve because the fingerprints are going to start to blend together >> I want to kick this off with a with a quote from IBM global managing partner of cyber security services Mark Hughes he wrote an article called training like it's real and he said and this is the quote the less prepared an organization is the more likely a single fishing email or fishing call could trigger a massive cyber crisis training employees and executives to respond effectively in these moments makes all the difference so I want to dig into this sentiment right what makes training particularly valuable when it comes to defending defending against and adapting to AIdriven cyber attacks. Uh Matt, I'll start with you. Do you have any thoughts on what makes training so valuable? >> Yeah, I think you know, learning repetitively, right? So, you know, not just not just kind of one exercise, but multiple exercises and getting that muscle memory down so people really kind of understand, hey, look, if something does happen, these are the steps and these is the device that I've been trained on to take. Whether that's reporting it, whether that's escalating it, you know, whether that's, you know, communicating with a a fellow partner or your manager, you know, those are the concepts of training and muscle memory that really become important when you're dealing with a potential incident or trying to identify, hey, is this a potential incident? >> I like this idea of muscle memory, right? Because it really emphasizes the fact that training isn't just about learning something new, it's about doing something new, right? Um Jake, I wanted to bring you in here, too. you know, do you have thoughts on what makes training so effective, so powerful for dealing with these AIdriven cyber attacks? >> Yeah, I I can even go back to a lot of my sports days as well, right? Like there's there's a saying that always comes in my head from a lot of my old coaches, right? Like amateurs will train until they get it right. Professionals train until they cannot get it wrong. And it is it is a difficult thing, right? Like you have to you don't can't just train when it's perfect. You can't just train when the sun is shining. You can't just train when it's convenient. It has to be you have to be stressed. You have to have bad days. It's like I talked about why is the human the weakest link, right? Because we have bad days because we're imperfect because we have we are a variable response. Uh it and so because of that like you have to train when you're not perfect. You have to train because you're you're a team of humans. As much as we want to orchestrate and automate with agentic AI a lot of our workflows, we're still humans and you and I think that's something we'll get into when we talk about the cyber range, right? You have to train with humans and you have to train as a team. And if you don't train as a team, you're not going to know when someone's having a good day or a bad day. You're not going to know what work rest cycle looks like. You're not going to know what what it's like to to to be at the end of your wits and then have to make really hard decisions that have ramifications to your entire company and all your shareholders, right? And that's something that I think shareholders, you know, expect of you expect of us, right? It's something we have to train for. >> I like that you bring in that kind of cognitive load, right? right? Like that psychology, that emotion that goes into it and because that too is a part of training that I think often gets overlooked, right? I we think of or at least I think of when I think cyber security training, right? I think about some slides you watch and you click through and whatever and it doesn't deal with that sort of thing, right? And so I think it's it's good that you highlight this as as an important aspect of training. And and speaking of which, cyber security training does get, you know, kind of a bad rep, right? Like I just said, I think a lot of us think of it as like it's the slideshow, it's the cheesy videos, it's it's whatever. and and and you know the people taking it often kind of joke about it and not really caring about it. The people presenting it are often like ah we're doing this because we have to tick a box. I'm wondering why training still has such a reputation when there is this different way to see it that Jake talked about that Matt talked about as something much more dynamic, something much more embodied. Uh Stephanie, I want to throw to you. What do you think it is that keeps training, you know, such a is seen as such a bad kind of negative not helpful thing? Right. >> Yeah. So I think what a lot of cyber security training that I've seen it optimizes for completion but not for capability and so it's it kind of becomes a checkbox at the end of the day and they're not really taking a step back and looking at things holistically and the issue all isn't always the training itself it's how organizations can implement it. It's not a one-sizefits-all solution. Um, one of the things that I like to look at for security awareness training, for example, is a lot of times says don't click on on links on bad links and don't give your password. Well, as from an attacker point of view, I'm not going to do those things. I'm going to be very creative with how I try to get information from you. So, I think it's a lack of showing real examples of how the organization is being attacked. Right? It's kind of like the boogeyman. We could tell people all day long, watch out for the boogeyman. If we don't actually sit there and describe the boogeyman's characteristics and who he targets and what he does, then it's hard for people to really see, understand, and know how to look out for that. >> I think there's also another component in there as well is people receive information differently, right? So, you know, from a security awareness perspective or education perspective, I mean, we have generations in the workforce now, right? So, some of them may want to actually read a element of cyber security awareness where somebody else might want, you know, a two-minute video around cyber security. Um, some people might want to be, you know, given some sort of puzzle where they've kind of be more interactive in it. So, I think the way that we actually give cyber security awareness training also has to be adaptive and relevant to the way that that people want to consume it. Um I think Jacob also mentioned another good point as he kind of was talking about different things is you know it deescalates your energy levels you know the more training that you get you know the less maybe heightened that you are in a particular scenario right so that repetition really starts to say hey look experienced this before you know either through an exercise or a simulation you know I don't feel as intense or concerned you know I'm gonna make a better decision now because I've gone through this before. >> Yeah, this is great. We're already starting to talk about what good training actually looks like, right? Like Stephanie, you had mentioned actually digging into the concrete real ways that organizations are being attacked. Matt, you mentioned the way it's got to be kind of adaptive, the way that it should be exercises that you're going through so you build that muscle memory. Jake, you have anything to add on there in terms of characteristics that you think make training like actually effective and actually powerful? I always focus on the person's feelings on the on the participants feelings. How did it make them feel from the beginning to the end? How can they how can you evoke an emotional response that actually causes them to internalize it to assess what's happening and changing within their within their own stress levels, right? Within their own psyche, their own brain, their own thoughts, their own workflows, and then put them into a decision where they're going to have to start thinking about it. and you want them to walk away and go, \"Man, I don't want to say that like that didn't suck, but man, that that was tough.\" Or, \"I really don't want that to suck that bad next time.\" Like, sometimes that's that's the most effective way. Trauma bonding does work. It's not the best way to it's not the most friendly way, but you do want people to feel you want it to change them. You want them to evolve during it. It's, you know, it's just like a a book, right? You assess a book from beginning to end. You know, how did they start coming in and how did they leave with it? And did it make them better? And you don't want the ends to justify the means. You don't want it to be something really terrible because Matt, you we want people to come back. We want the rest of our team to continue to join. We don't want to make this a terrible experience so they begrudgingly come angry at it every time. But you do want them to realize, man, this was really helpful. And it's not helpful just for my job, it's helpful for my life. >> And so now that we've started building up, you know, some of these qualities of good training, right? talking about realism, the emotional impact, the the dynamic kind of simulation impact. Let's get into an example of a concrete example of that kind of training that ticks out those boxes. And I'm talking of course about the cyber range. Now, for listeners who may not be familiar with what exactly a cyber range is, let's start with a definition. Um, and I'll and I'll throw to you Stephanie. Can you explain to us what is a cyber range and how is it different from just like any other traditional tabletop exercise? >> Yeah, absolutely. So um at IBM our cyber ranges are I like to call it control chaos in an environment where we really stress test executive and technical teams through simulated cyber crisises. Um so we work really closely with an individual at the uh organization like okay what keeps you up at night? What are your concerns? What would you like to test? And we create a whole immersive multi-our scenario to test their team and the people they want to bring in. So it's real people. It's real adversary behaviors. Um unlike table talks which is a little bit more roleplaying, uh this is as immersive and hands-on as we can make it to really stress test what um could happen in these type of um engagements. >> I like the word immersive. You know, the way I try and to convey it to folks, right, to adapt that is like think if you're learning a second language, right? And and then you're put in an environment with a room of people that only speak that second language that you're learning and you have to actually effectively communicate to them. That's the immersive experience that you're getting is, hey, you're not just reading a book. You're actually taking potentially what you learned and you're applying it and then seeing if the other people are comprehending and understanding what you're saying. >> And Matt, right, that there's words that you got to learn, you can't use. Correct. >> There's words that are insults. There's words that are touch words. They're landmines, right? Like you got to really learn that language, right? And that vernacular, right? Yeah. You can't just stub your toe and put your foot in your mouth, right? Sometimes those have massive legal ramifications. >> Yeah. So, you know, we've already started touching on exactly what it is that makes, you know, a real training in a realistic immersive environment more effective than other kinds of training. Talking about learning to speak that language, which I think is a very powerful metaphor. And Jake, I know you've not to put too fine a point on it. You've already been talking about the emotional side of side of things, but I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about, you know, what it is about this realistic in scenario environment that makes it that brings such particular benefits that makes people walk away being like, \"Wow, I I really feel like I experienced something I didn't have before.\" Can you say a little bit about that? >> A lot of people walk in, they go, \"Gosh, just is there a right answer to this? What tell me what I got to do to get out of this?\" like that they're used to multiple choice sections and you know security awareness training where there is a right answer right and it's dynamic lots of times there isn't the right answer there's just a less wrong answer a best of bad choices that sometimes you have to make and that's really difficult right um now I would also say there are there is a structure to the response you could there is a science to this it's not all art so hey here are some of the building blocks to the scientific response right and if you think about you know again back to the milit military, right? I don't care who's sitting in that seat in this job, in this function, this role. I don't care who's sitting in it. You have expectations of what we're looking for you to do. Here's the 10 core things that everyone's looking at you to do. You are the head of your function, the head of your entire company at doing this. These 10 things, we're all looking for you to do this. And if you don't know, you got to find someone else to call. There's external help out there. You got to have your rolodex of people you can call on. And I need you to be confident in that. Right? So, there is a science. You can write playbooks out. There are ways to prepare yourself in that. So you can you can think about it. You can rehearse it. Matt, you can walk in with the playbook. So when you sit in that seat, you could be more confident. But lots of times, you know, the sadly the first time you ever get you when you get faced with one of these crises, it might be the first time you've ever read that playbook or you've ever read that plan and you want to try and practice it, but maybe you don't get that chance. Maybe you're brand new to the company. But I would sure as I would sure like to whoever sits in that seat, if they're brand new to the company, there still is a hey, here's a list of expectations. >> Yeah, that's a really good point. I think about how the this dynamic simulation, this immersive simulation let you practice both the art and the science, right? Like it lets you both practice the plan, you try to implement the theory, but also deal with the fact that theory doesn't always map cleanly onto reality, right? Sometimes things don't go the way you planned them to go or wanted them to go. And so, you have to make those more artful decisions. And I think that's a really great kind of encapsulation of what makes the cyber range training so powerful. But I was wondering, you know, if anybody here has any, I don't know, stories about anything you've seen in the cyber range or work you've done in the cyber range that you feel like helps illustrate what makes it so valuable. >> I think going back to what Jacob said about, you know, the feelings perspective, right? So, you know, a tabletop exercise when you're kind of talking through a particular scenario, it's a little different when right in front of you all of a sudden, you know, your screen locks up, you know, and there's a threat actor image on your screen and now the telephone's ringing and someone's asking you a question, you know, so you emotions really start to come out, right? I mean, all of a sudden this laptop, you know, and again, I mean, this that's yours, you know, you're now locked out of. um and all of a sudden you're receiving a phone call and you're being questioned on, hey, what are you seeing? What are you identifying? Um and being able to respond, you know, under that type of pressure is a little bit different, you know, than your traditional tabletops where you're just kind of asking that question. So, I mean, there's a visual perspective of it. Um there's, you know, all your different senses are being tested kind of your your vision, your eyes, you know, all those emotions kind of come through it. Um and really you're you have to respond in kind in that environment. >> Yeah. Yeah, I think the cyber ranges, they don't just teach skills, but they really build confidence under stress. And that's really what we repeat over and over as much as we can. And a lot of times when we get folks that leave, that's some of their biggest takeaways is, \"Wow, this is something we really have to practice.\" Cuz a lot of times we see folks, they know things on paper, it makes sense. But when you actually have to put them in a room with other people and put it into practice, you start to see things crumble quite a bit, which is very common if it's not practice. And so that's why we have a lot of our clients coming back over and over because they know how important this is to keep doing, keep getting it right, keep finding where those flaws are before they're doing it in a actual, you know, real attack. >> It's really funny, right? Like you'll have companies come in or, you know, we'll see companies come in, there's an all-star, there's someone who really is confident, who really has exercises, has been through it in real life, and is really leading the charge. And when you really get dynamic, you can walk over and you can tap that person on the shoulder and say, \"Ah, you just got called home sick because your you just got called home because your kid is sick, right? Or or you got the flu, right? Or I want to remind you all this will occur over 180 days. You're going to get sick. You got to go on vacation.\" Like there are there's real life that happens outside of this work life. So yeah, it's time for you to take a break. You're doing too good right now. Like we need to increase the stress level to the team and make them realize you can't play hero ball. like you can't rely on one person just to do this, right? And so when you do that, then the team realizes, oh, we all got to step up, who who's going to fill in that person, who so you start thinking about chain of command, right? And so these are things that you get used to. Again, kind of the military background. This is just natural order for, you know, for a lot of my, you know, my prior life. But people start realizing, oh, who is that second person up? Do we have a redundancy behind them? Is that is that person a single point of failure collectively on the team in the way we behave as a team? but also who sits into that role, right? And I think it's one of the things most important is when we try to remind people like, hey, these 3, four hours, however we long we're in here, this actually is a prolonged period. This will occur for 20, 40, 60, you know, a very long period of time and this isn't going to go away and then you're going to have a legal tale to it, right? So, you better get comfortable with being uncomfortable here, right? That's where we want people to be to get to. >> Absolutely. So given everything we've said today about the value of training and especially the cyber range training, the simulation training, it seems kind of clear to me that one of the primary tasks in front of us is to get organizations to see that security training is is a strategic lever, right? It's like a critical control. It's not just a a support role or tick the box compliance exercise, right? It shouldn't be optimized for completion as you said, Stephanie. So how do we start moving in that direction? Right? Do we have thoughts on on how we actually get people to start seeing training as a critical control? Uh Matt, I'll start with you. Do you have any thoughts there? I I think one of the takeaways from the the range perspective is that because those emotions come out, because those feelings actually happen, you know, when you go back to work and you receive a fishing simulation or you see an article that's posted around security awareness or a video, you're more compelled to look at that particular, you know, piece of information and actually pay attention because you've experienced something that brought out a level of emotion, you know, a trigger, so to speak, in you where you're saying, \"Hey, look, I really need to pay attention to this now. I've seen what the potential downside or impact of that could be to myself or to the organization. So now I really want to pay attention to it.\" So I think, you know, Jacob, back to your point of, hey, you're in a particular exercise for a period of time and and it is a long period of time of you're saying, hey, how do I get out of this? When does it ultimately end? But I do think your takeaway is when you do go back to the office ultimately saying, \"Hey, now I'm seeing the training information coming out, I should pay attention to it.\" Because again, the more you're paying attention to it, the decrease of that stress level is going to come down. If you ever get into that particular exercise or that scenario again, it'll start to come down. >> I love that. It's like the cyber range itself becomes a way of driving home that message of how critical this kind of stuff is. Um, Stephanie, your thoughts on on this issue? Yeah. So, I guess I like to think of training like fire drills, right? We shouldn't run them because we know there's a fire tomorrow or compliance says we should, but really we should run them because we don't want confusion to spread. We want people to know where to go. They they know where they should be. I mean, practice saves lives in in fire drills, right? But security training should be the same. It shouldn't be awareness. It should be all about preparedness. And Jake, your thoughts on on kind of driving home this message on the strategic value of training. >> I like to focus on, you know, why does your company exist and organization exist and not just that, but what is your function within that? And why does your function exist within the organization, right? And so a lot of the lessons that you learn in security, you know, instant response, crisis management, you know, business continuity, disaster, all of these lessons can be baked into every role in the function. Whether that's, hey, who's your backup? or whether that's hey how do we document what we actually do here and how does that input you know actually how does our output of what we do lead to an input of why the company exists most of the time that's to make money in one shape one way shape or form right to by delivering a good or service or producing something right um so I'd like to really think about like hey all of these lessons that you learn in a cyber attack or a cyber crisis right all of these lessons can be baked in everywhere throughout the business continuity throughout the business because we all exist to make sure the business is continuing to thrive. We're all shareholders in the success of the business, right? And I I think that as you can kind of get the participants to shift their perspective as this is a compliance-driven exercise to this is how we make sure collectively our business continues to thrive, right? This is a this is the survival and not just survival but thriving of our business. And that's where you want to get people to, you know, to emotionally align themselves to and become invested in. >> Yeah. I I think there's an element of team building that comes out of it too. You know, you you all kind of went through this particular scenario, you know, and you made it out. Um, and then ultimately, you feel more confident when you're reaching out to individuals that, you know, you're not so, hey, do I need to report this? Should I report this? Hey, I'm going to report this because I've got a relationship something that I experienced before, you know, bubbled up into something larger in the exercise. Now, I don't want that to ultimately happen. So relationship and team building, you know, becomes prominent as well. >> So Matt, we talked about closing the assumptions gap, right? Like one thing that's super fun in these exercises is you'll ask somebody, \"Hey, I who are you telling right now?\" And you you'll see the CEO be like, \"What do you mean you're not telling me?\" But then like the all the participants in the in the room will be like, \"Sir, man, these things happen like 65 times a year. I can't tell you every time.\" And so it closes that assumptions gap really re really effectively because then as you know as Matt as you're saying right oh I built a relationship with you I'm going to call you because I knew you had an assumption I should call you. It might not be documented it but and you might have you know because you were really collaborative during this exercise I might call you to problem solve elsewhere and a very like that's one of the real outputs in there. Yeah, I love how this conversation has really highlighted the fact that something that you that the cyber range has that other forms of training don't necessarily have is that human element, those relationships that those emotions cuz again I just I think that you know at least for me as as as a sort of outsider here um I don't think about that stuff when I think about cyber security training necessarily right I do think about just the pure technical hard-nosed kind of stuff but this stuff is just as important and I think it's really really uh valuable that it's such a focus of the cyber range So look, we we've had this this a very wide-ranging conversation over the last half hour here. And to kind of close us out today, I'm just want to ask each of you, you know, if you could boil this conversation down to like one core takeaway, one thing that you want anybody listening to this to walk away knowing or doing, what would that be? And um I'll start with you, Stephanie. What's your kind of core takeaway from all this? >> Yeah, my core takeaway would be AI has changed the speed of attacks, but training has changed the outcome. I love that. Uh Jake, how about you? What's your takeaway? >> Just practice, practice, practice, practice. Teamwork, team building, practice. It's it's never the wrong time. It's it's don't wait till it Don't wait till it's checked. Embedded to everything you do in life. >> Absolutely. And Matt, close us out here. What's your takeaway? >> Yeah, I think capitalize on AI as an augmentation, right? Continue to focus on the foundational side of things. Um utilize AI to the best of its ability. um build that human in the loop to to you know confirm what you're actually seeing. Um and then back to what Jake said, you know, rinse and repeat. You know, you can't just do it kind of once, you've got to do it multiple times um and continuous training. >> So that's all the time we have for today, folks. I want to thank our panelists, Matt, Jake, and Stephanie. Thank you to the viewers and the listeners. Please subscribe to Security Intelligence wherever podcasts are found. Stay safe out there and remember that security training is as effective as you make it.",
