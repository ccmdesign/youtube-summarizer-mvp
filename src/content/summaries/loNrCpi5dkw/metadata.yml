title: "Side Hustle King: 6 $60K/Mo Businesses Nobody's Doing"
description: >-
  In this episode, I sat down with Chris Koerner and we go through a set of
  approachable startup ideas that start low-friction but can scale if you get
  distribution right. We start with a potential “app ecosystem” opportunity
  around Facebook Marketplace, plus a product-studio framework that combines
  short-form video, AI, and 3D printing to validate “dumb” products via demand
  before you invest. We then jump to more grounded, local-first ideas—bike
  washing/maintenance subscriptions, bar anti-spike stickers, and even
  vending-machine concepts like “shiny rock” drops at trailheads. We close with
  a weird Pokémon-card “meme + supply control” play inspired by the Kabuto King,
  including Chris’s own collecting “big reveal.” From there, I dig into why
  PSA-style grading feels slow and expensive, and we workshop a more modern
  grading experience (including a livestream/packaging angle and an
  AI-from-photo approach).

  Key Points


  * I look for “alpha” where people are already obsessing, but the market
  structure is still primitive (like collectibles + grading).

  * I treat “distribution” as the multiplier—short-form can make “dumb” products
  viable if the content loop is strong.

  * I push for starting manually first (prove demand), then upgrading into
  infrastructure, subscriptions, and scale.

  * I pay attention to marketplaces with huge usage but weak third-party
  tooling—there’s often a platform-layer opportunity there.

  * I keep coming back to “repackaging” as a business model: same underlying
  thing, new wrapper, new buyer, new channel.


  Numbered Section Summaries


  1. Facebook Marketplace: Massive Demand, Weak Tooling

  I react to Chris’s point that Facebook Marketplace is enormous, and the weird
  part is how few legit third-party tools exist—especially compared to
  ecosystems like eBay. We talk about seller tooling ideas (alerts, scanning,
  arbitrage workflows) and why “edge” is worth paying for if you make your
  living in Marketplace.


  2. The Product Studio Loop: Short-Form + AI + 3D Printers

  Chris lays out a framework I like: short-form video is the distribution
  engine, AI helps you generate and iterate concepts, and 3D printing lets you
  prototype fast—then you don’t invest real money until you’ve got demand
  (preorders) and a simple storefront. I also push on the cultural angle: people
  “hate AI,” so you can intentionally add one “pointless AI” feature that sparks
  comments and fuels distribution.


  3. Local-First, Cash-Flow Ideas: Bikes, Bars, And Vending

  We get more grounded: I ask how you’d start a bike-washing or maintenance
  concept, and Chris argues you don’t need manufacturing—start with a rented
  trailer and a cheap pressure washer, prove it manually, then scale into
  subscriptions and repeatable ops. We also cover bar-focused anti-spike
  stickers (cheap unit economics + subscriptions + optional ads) and end with
  trailhead vending-machine ideas like “shiny rocks,” where the product is
  simple and the placement does the heavy lifting.


  4. The Kabuto King Play: Make A Meme, Control Supply

  I walk through the Kabuto King story with Chris: an anonymous collector buys
  up a “lame” first-edition card, tweets about it, and turns the character into
  a meme—then the price moves because attention + accumulation becomes the
  product.
