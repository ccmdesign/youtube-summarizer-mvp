  What’s really happening inside Claude Opus 4.5 and its push into long-running AI agents?
  The common story is that it’s “the best model,” but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on how Opus handles real-world work:
  • Why it stays coherent in long, messy agentic tasks
  • How it compresses context and avoids hard window failures
  • What I learned from a handwritten OCR reconciliation stress test
  • Where it outperforms Gemini and GPT-5.1 in ambiguous workflows

  Opus 4.5 is becoming a reliable hire for operators who need LLMs that don’t fall apart when the work gets messy.
