  Following on from my first video on the RLMs paper, this is a more structured
  breakdown of the key mental models you need to understand why this approach
  matters.

  The core insight: context window is only half the story. Task complexity -
  specifically the internal self-referencing nature of documents like legal
  contracts and codebases - is what actually breaks AI agents.

  In this video I cover:


  Context rot and why it's a function of both context length AND task complexity

  Why stuffing everything into an LLM doesn't work (and can actually make things
  worse)

  Why summarization is lossy and causes agents to drift off task

  Why RAG breaks down when you need multi-hop reasoning

  The mental model shift: treating complex documents as dependency graphs, not
  storybooks

  How the REPL + recursion approach enables intelligent search and synthesis

  Limitations and when NOT to use this approach


  This matters if you're building agents for legal analysis, policy review,
  codebase reasoning, or any workflow involving complex document synthesis.
