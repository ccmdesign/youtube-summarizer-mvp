title: Why Claude Cowork is a Big Deal
description: >-
  Claude Cowork brings Claude Code agent capabilities to non‑technical users by
  enabling local file and connector access and automating multi‑step workflows.
  Audience reactions mix excitement about APIs, scheduling, and parallel task
  automation with warnings about prompt‑injection and destructive file actions.
  Implications include accelerated productization and UI work to reach
  mainstream users, expanded demand for workplace agents, and market
  opportunities for startups rather than immediate vendor displacement.
