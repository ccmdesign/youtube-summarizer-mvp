title: "Agent OS v3: Leaner & Smarter for Building in 2026"
description: >-
  Agent OS v3 is here — rebuilt from the ground up for how we actually build in
  2026.


  I stripped out 70% of the framework. What's left: a leaner system for
  discovering, documenting, and injecting your coding standards into AI-powered,
  spec-driven development.


  In this video, I'll show you:


  - The new 'discover-standards' command for surfacing your opinionated patterns
  and documenting standards.

  - The new smart injection system for using your standards... anywhere,
  anytime.

  - The new way to write better, more aligned specs—without changing how you
  build with Claude Code or Cursor.

  - Using profiles for managing different standards across project types
