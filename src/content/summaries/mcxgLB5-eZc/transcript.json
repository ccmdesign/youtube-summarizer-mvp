  "fullText": "Working on legacy code bases is proving to be one of the harder challenges in AI powered development in 2026. Your agents can read every file in your project, but they don't understand why you built things the way that you did. The reasoning behind your conventions, the patterns that your team refined over the years, the architectural decisions that shape everything. None of that comes through when an agent scans your code. So, every time you prompt, you're reexplaining, you're reteing, you're reestablishing context that should already be baked in. I created Agent OS to fill that gap. It's a lightweight system for defining and managing your coding standards in AI powered development. And today I'm releasing version three. It's stripped down by 70% yet it's more useful than ever for how we actually build here in 2026. Now, if you saw my last video on the channel where I said cloud code is all you need, I also promised a follow-up showing what I actually want out of a utility framework. This is that video. The philosophy behind version 3 of Agent OS is simple. Don't reinvent what the core tools already do well. Strip away everything that overlaps with Cloud Code's native features and keep only what fills the gaps that professionals and teams actually care about. Now, if you're new to the channel, I'm Brian Castle. I help professional builders stay ahead of the curve with AI first development. And every Friday, I send my builder briefing. That's a free 5minute read. No hype, just my take on this transition into building with AI. You can get my next one by going to buildermethods.com. Now, agent OS has always been built around specdriven development. The idea that we should plan before we build, shape the work first, and then let agents execute. So, when I first released Agent OS back in mid2025, the tooling wasn't quite there yet. So, I created Agent OS to build in scaffolding for writing specs and breaking them into task lists and orchestrating implementation. But since then, cloud code and cursor and others have evolved significantly. Plan mode is now a first class feature and today's frontier models are dramatically better at maintaining context and executing complex multi-step plans without losing the thread. So the question became what does agent OS actually need to do now if anything? The answer is it should fill the gaps that vanilla cloud code doesn't address without stepping on the features that it already handles well. So in the new agent OS version 3 I reduced its footprint by 70% and in doing so made it significantly more useful. So let me explain what stayed and what's new. So agent OS was always built on the idea that you define your standards first. You know your conventions for how you build things like our API responses use this structure or our components follow this naming convention. Standards are kind of similar to what you might put in your claw.md file, but agent OS gives you a system to inject only what's relevant and not load everything into context every time. What's new in V3 is that Agent OS now discovers and writes your standards for you. So, you can run a command, point it at an area of your codebase, and it analyzes what's there, looking for patterns that are unusual or opinionated, you know, things that a new developer or an agent wouldn't know without being told. So, it interviews you with targeted questions to capture your reasoning behind what it found. This is knowledge that used to exist in between the lines of your code or in your head, but now formalized and accessible in a way that your agents can actually use. Second, Asian OS gives you enhanced spec shaping. So, plan mode is now the industry standard for spec driven development and is built right into cloud code and cursor and most major tools. So, Agent OS enhances that by helping you shape your specs with targeted questions that take your standards and your product's mission into account. Agent OS also saves your plans into persistent spec folders, something that cloud code doesn't do by default. Third is profiles. So this lets you maintain different sets of standards for different project types. So maybe you have a Laravel profile and a marketing site profile and an internal tools profile. Set them up once and then choose the right one when you're starting up a new project. And Agent OS version 3 gives you a new way to sync your standards from your current project into a profile so that you can port them into other projects later. Okay, let me show you what this looks like in practice. So, I'm going to use my buildermethods.com codebase for the demos that I'm going to show here. And this is a Rails application uh including the the front end as well as like the members area for builder methods pro, the videos library, our workshops. So, I've been working on this site and the backend app for a while now, and it's uh it's a somewhat legacy codebase with with some established patterns that are just starting to be formally documented. So, it's a perfect candidate for agent OS. Now, I have already installed agent OS on my system by following the uh installation instructions. You know, first you would clone the repo to your home directory on your system. That's your base installation. And then you would install agent OS into each individual project by using our project install script. So I have already done that in my uh builder methods project here. And so that put this agent OS folder into the project. And inside that we've got a product folder. I've already run the agent OS plan product command which helped me establish my product mission uh the road map and the tech stack through this codebase. It also has a specs folder. So, I've been using previous versions of Agent OS to uh to create these specs. And I'm going to continue using that specs folder as I move forward now with Agent OS version 3. And then we have the standards folder. And this is where we document our conventions and the knowledge behind our codebase. And so I've already done that here in the builder methods codebase. And so I have this folder in there called agent OS. And inside that I've got a product folder. So this was generated when I ran the agent OS plan product command that helped me establish the mission for the product, the road map and the text stack for this codebase. And I have some specs from the previous versions of Agent OS in there. I can continue to use this specs folder going forward. And I have the standards folder. This is where I'm documenting those conventions and the the knowledge behind my project. Now, if you've just installed AgentOS into a project for the first time, the first thing that you'll probably want to do is run the plan product command. Now, I've already done that here, but again, that will uh establish your your product's mission and road map and tech stack. But the other thing that you'll want to do early and often throughout the life cycle of your project is discovering and documenting new standards from your codebase. Now I'm going to do this in cloud code but you can do this in any agent cursor agent or any of the modern tools these days. So I'm going to start by running discover standards command. And so what this is going to do is it's going to look around my codebase and start to identify some big focus areas that we can then dive into and look for some unique patterns that might be worth documenting. So here it found a few big focus areas like you know controllers, models, views and components. I could go with one of those or I can direct it toward a specific area of my codebase. Now I actually do want to create some standards around the views and components. That's something that I have not yet documented in my standard. So I'm going to go ahead and go with that option. throughout agent OS. Now, we're using the ask user question tool, which is built into cloud code, which gives us that really nice Q&A interface to ask us these questions and proceed with these workflows. Now, it's analyzing all of my views and components, and what it's specifically looking for are the areas that appear to be unique or opinionated and follow a repeatable pattern. Those are the types of things that we want to actually document into standards. We don't necessarily just want to write standards that teach agents how to code in a conventional way because agents already do that. So agent OS is going to help to find those unique knowledge in your codebase. All right, so it found about five unique patterns in my views and components and all of these sound pretty accurate to how the codebase is structured. So um you know I could select individual ones to proceed with but I'm going to go with the first option which is yeah let's create standards for all of them. And so instead of rushing into documenting these standards and making some assumptions, the agent is actually going to interview me to understand the reasoning behind why things were designed or architected a certain way. You know, it's asking me like, what problem does this particular pattern solve? And these are really good strategic and design questions that we want to bake into the knowledge that's in our system here. And again, I can use the uh suggested answers or I can uh give a little bit more color to my reasoning and and design patterns here. So, the way that it works is it asks one or two questions about each new standard. Then it goes ahead and drafts that standard. And the key here is to keep the standards really concise. We don't want to eat up too much of the context window when we pull them into the context. So, it's going to show us the draft and then I can approve it or skip it or give it some feedback. I'll approve this one. So, it's going to go ahead and write it up and save it. And now we're moving right along into the next standard that it identified. So, it's going to ask me a question. And I gave it a quick confirmation. And now it's going to go ahead and write it up. Looks good. Create it. So, I'm going to have it go through the rest of these now. And this is a cycle that you can repeat periodically throughout the life cycle of your product as it evolves, as the codebase grows. And uh you know, especially after you've added a whole new section to your to your codebase, it's probably a good time to go ahead and discover any new standards that may have surfaced. Now, when you get to the end of the process of discovering and writing up new standards, Asian OS will index your standards. And it does that inside your standards folder, you have an index.yaml file. So, this is a list of each of the individual uh standards files uh within the folder that they live in. And each standards file gets a oneline simple description. And so the reason we do it this way, of course, is so that uh the agent doesn't need to read the entire contents of every single standard file, which would read all of that content into the context window every single time. This enables it to identify which standards are available just by reading these descriptions. And then it lets you choose or it will suggest standards to inject. This is very similar to the way that Claude skills work. skills also are not read into uh the context by default and the agent can identify the skills uh based on their descriptions. In fact, agent OS can also help you surface available skills to inject along with your agent OS standards. So real quick, you know, like the difference between a a cloud skill and an agent OS standard. A skill is more of a processoriented task that you want to invoke and then run uh the same way every time. Whereas the standards that you would document with agent OS are again, you know, conventions and uh best practices and your opinions and your design patterns that it might use and apply in different ways depending on the task. So, I'm going to finish up that last process of uh indexing those new standards that we've just added to our list. And by the way, uh if you ever need to just index your your list of standards, like if you've uh added some manually or something like that, you can always use the index standards command. That's another uh tool that's available inside uh cloud code. And so, now that we have a a pretty good set of standards all documented and and set up in my agent OS folder in this codebase, let's actually use them. And what's really nice about Agent OS version 3 is that you can use and inject your standards anywhere, anytime. You can inject them when you're just prompting in a conversation. You can just run inject standards there. Or you can inject standards when you're planning a spec, and I'll show you that in a minute. Or if you're using Claude to create a new Claude skill. In fact, let's go ahead and create a new Claude skill. I want to create one that will help me create new UI components in my codebase. And I'm going to inject my agent OS standards into the makeup of that skill. So here we go. First, I'm going to use the uh skill creator skill which was created by the cloud team and I installed that on my system. Uh so I'm going going to use the skill creator. I'm going to use dictation here. Let's create a skill for creating new UI components in our codebase. Okay, so this is the normal process of you know starting to create a new skill. Now this part of the demo is not agent OS. This you like any any cloud code user can do this. Again we want to be using the core claude code features and functionalities in the best way that they are designed to be used. And now at some point in the process, it could be during the Q&A process, you can choose to type something or I can just hit the uh escape key to to just pause it before we start building the skill because before we do, I want to make sure that we are injecting our agent OS standards. So I'm going to go ahead and run inject standards. I'll just tab into that. The first thing it's going to do is it's going to detect what are we doing here? It's going to read the current conversation and here it identified that we're clearly creating a skill. And so it's going to ask me how should these standards be included in the skill. And there are basically two options available here. One is we can reference the standards which means we're going to add lines in the skill files with these at references. And the benefit of that approach is that our standards can continue to live in our standards folder and they'll be referenced by the skill files. So if we make changes and update our standards over time, then those will remain up to date. The other option is we can copy the contents of those standards directly into the skill files like kind of like hardcode it into the skill files. Depends on the context and your current needs and and what the skill is for. In my case, in this particular one, I'm going to go ahead and choose the the referencing option because this is only going to live within this one codebase and I want my standards to be documented in a single place. And so here we go. Uh what agent OS just did was it's adding this instruction to the agent that is creating the skill and that is it's going to uh reference this list of standards. And by the way, agent OS in a smart way identified exactly which of my standards from my list of standards that like should be included in this skill. And it did that by reading through my standards index file. All right. All right. So, I'm going to leave the rest of this skill creation for, you know, off camera and we're just going to move on with the video here. So, a driving force behind agent OS in its early days last year and into this year in 2026 is specd driven development. And the way that we do specdriven development now that cloud code is so good and cursor is so good is we use plan mode for that. So, I'm going to demonstrate how I will plan out and spec out a new feature for builder methods. So, uh, before I get into that, um, what are we actually going to to spec out here? So, in Builder Methods, when, uh, when Builder Methods Pro members are logged in, we've got a few different areas, including our videos library and the workshops. We already have some like topic filtering, but we don't actually have a search feature. And so the way that I would start developing this new feature into my uh application would be to go into CL cloud code and I will enter plan mode with shift tab until it says plan mode on. So you know of course I could just proceed with planning out a spec and having a conversation with Claude about that and then having Claude go ahead and write up the plan and then have it implement the plan and most of the time that would be just fine. uh but we do have agent OS so we want to make sure that we will inject our standards and we want to make sure that we are shaping up our plan in the best possible way and that's one of the big strengths of uh agent OS version 3. So now that I'm in plan mode and this will only work if I'm in plan mode I can run shape spec that is going to start the uh questions process where the agent is going to interview me with its clarifying questions and I'll describe it. I want to build a search feature. So, I think that's a good start. There's probably a few more details that I'll want to, you know, work into the plan here, but um that'll be enough to get the process started. So, it's going to ask some clarifying questions to really target and enhance our specs before we go and and actually write them up into plans. And so, here's one of those questions that is powered by Agent OS. It's going to ask me if I have any visuals that I could reference or mockups or wireframes or screenshots of similar features. And normally that's a good idea to add, but I think I'll just skip them. This is another one I always like to have the agent ask when planning a spec, and that is, are there any similar sections in this codebase that I should reference? Here you could see cloud code has taken upon itself to run three different agents and one of them is checking for product context and standards. And it's looking at agent OS here to see uh the product mission, the road map, the tech stack and the standards that we have. Okay. So it identified on its own a set of standards that might apply um to this particular build based on the content that we've discussed in this uh in this like shape spec process. Yeah, I think all four of these standards do apply. So I'll go ahead and say yeah, use these. And so it went ahead and read in um those individual standards so that they will help inform the plan. So it's going ahead and it's writing up the the spec or or the plan if you will. All right. So Cloud Code has completed its work of creating the plan and here's that that entire plan. You know it takes into account all of the standards including our uh product mission and roadmap and everything. So it it has that knowledge baked in. But you'll notice that there is an interesting task one added to the very beginning of this plan. So the first thing that it's going to do is actually create a spec folder in the agent OS specs folder. Give it a date, give it a name, and it's going to save this plan along with the Q&A session that we shaped up. So that's the piece where agent OS will have cloud code or cursor actually save its plan into the specs folder in agent OS. Now, one thing to note is it won't actually do that while you're still in plan mode. That's why it added it as the first task to do before it starts to actually implement this plan. Um, so I'm going to go ahead and proceed with this. Yes. And and bypass permissions. And we're going to see it uh actually save the plan to the specs folder. So here we go. That is task number one. Again, you know, the building out the tasks from the plan. That's a core part of spec driven development that I've been talking about all throughout last year. Now, that is a first class feature in cloud code. Um, so we just leave that sort of thing to cloud code because it is much better at tracking its own task list and working off of its own plan made from plan mode. And here we go. This folder right here, it has uh today's date. And so now it's going to actually save the the planning documents for this spec into that folder. Okay, so it's just done that. So now while it continues with the rest of this implementation, we can actually see the spec all documented and saved right in our specs folder. So let's take a look at that. So first we have plan.md. This is essentially the spec, right? This is the plan. Everything that it that it planned out all documented and saved. So we have that for reference. So it found some uh similar patterns in the codebase that it's going to build this this plan around. Um here is shape.md. So this is like a recap of the early shaping conversation that I had with cloud code uh again powered by agent OS. And then we do have a standards.mmd which uh kind of lists out exactly which standards we want to include in the plan. And in this case we're not referencing the standards. It just hardcoded them into the standards uh MD. All right. So it did finish up uh implementing the search features. Let's just check it out. I'm on the local environment now. So got some test data here. And here we go. So here is the search and yeah, it does filter correctly. Right. So like there's a few little tweaks that I'll probably make to the UI. So I'm going to get those details polished up and then we'll get this thing shipped. So like I said, you can inject agent OS standards anytime, anywhere in your normal development workflow with cloud code or with cursor or any other tool. So, I'm going to show you an example of this. In a case where we're just doing a small task, like a small design tweak that doesn't even warrant building out a whole spec or or a plan, we can still make use of our agent OS standards in this situation. So, let me show you. As an example, I'm going to find something really small that I want to tweak. Like on the agent OS page, I'm using this kind of red brand color here. Then it goes to these other brand colors down here. I want to sort of subbrand agent OS to use our red color everywhere in a couple different places. So, I took a few screenshots of the spots that I want to tweak that color on. So, in this case, I'm just going to use a simple prompt, right? So, uh I'm just going to get that started, you know, but before we get too far along, I just hit escape to stop it. So, so far we have a little bit of context in the conversation. You can stop it and run inject standards. So I'm going to run that now and let's see how agent OS behaves in this scenario. So here like under the hood agent OS knows that we're just you know in a regular conversation. We're not creating a skill. We're not planning out a spec. Uh so it went ahead and checked our index YAML to find the list of standards that we have available and then it picked out the ones that are most relevant to this particular task because it sees that we are trying to do some visual CSS tweaks. So it found my CSS color standards which I have in my uh in my agent OS standards already. And so it went ahead and it read that standards file and then it output its contents into the context of this conversation. So now when it proceeds with making this change, it's going to take that into account. Now of course this was a super simple example and but I wanted to show you uh the motion that you can take when you're in a small or even a long conversation. You can use that inject standards command anytime you want to inject your standards and agent OS will have this system to identify which standards you want to place in there. Of course, if you want to just call out specific standards, you can simply at reference those in any spot that you need to as well. So, who is Agent OS for? Well, if you have a legacy codebase with undocumented patterns, Agent OS helps you surface and capture that knowledge so that agents can finally understand the why behind your code. If you're on a team adopting specdriven development, Agent OS keeps everyone aligned on standards and processes. And if you've been overwhelmed by framework complexity, Agent OS is lighter than ever. It doesn't try to replace cloud code. It fills the gaps that matter. Agent OS is free and open- source. You can get it by going to buildermethods.com/ aent OS along with all the documentation. And if you want support, training, and access to live workshops on building with AI, that's what builder methods pro. We've got hundreds of members in there who are sharing their projects and asking questions with me and our community of builders. And one more thing, if you're starting a brand new project from scratch where there is no legacy codebase, where you're building something from zero, I have another free open- source tool called Design OS along with a full video walkthrough that's specifically aimed at rethinking the design phase when you're architecting a new product in Cloud Code. So, be sure to subscribe to the channel so you don't miss these updates, and I'll see you in the next video. Let's keep building.",
