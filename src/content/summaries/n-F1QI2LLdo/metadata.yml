title: TestSprite MCP + Your PRD = Let the AI Test the AI Code
description: >-
  Stop skipping testing when you code with AI. This is the #1 mistake I see
  people make.


  Testing is the second most important thing you should do after planning
  (creating a PRD). Every new line of code is a potential breaking change, and
  AI doesn't know when it's wrong. It doesn't have your full project context, so
  bugs cascade and compound.


  Big companies use test-driven development, CI/CD pipelines, and QA testers for
  a reason. But TDD breaks down when you veer from your plan (which always
  happens with AI), and CI/CD only checks if code runs, not if it actually
  works.


  That's why I am using the Testsprite MCP server, which writes tests after the
  code is written, using my PRD to understand what I'm actually building. 

  It's like having a QA engineer on call.
