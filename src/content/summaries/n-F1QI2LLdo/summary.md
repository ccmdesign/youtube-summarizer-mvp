  Stop skipping testing when you code with AI. This is the #1 mistake I see people make.
  
  Testing is the second most important thing you should do after planning (creating a PRD). Every new line of code is a potential breaking change, and AI doesn't know when it's wrong. It doesn't have your full project context, so bugs cascade and compound.
  
  Big companies use test-driven development, CI/CD pipelines, and QA testers for a reason. But TDD breaks down when you veer from your plan (which always happens with AI), and CI/CD only checks if code runs, not if it actually works.
  
  That's why I am using the Testsprite MCP server, which writes tests after the code is written, using my PRD to understand what I'm actually building. 
  It's like having a QA engineer on call.

## Key Takeaways

Testing is critical for reliable AI-assisted development. Key insights:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** prevents cascading errors by validating tasks before proceeding but struggles with AI's changing specs.

- **Test

Sprite MCP** uses your PRD + codebase to auto-generate holistic tests, acting like an AI QA engineer that catches UI/functionality breaks.

- Upload PRDs to configure tests for frontend/backend, provide login details, and get visual failure reports + AI-fix recommendations.

## Summary

### The Testing Imperative in AI Development
Skipping testing when coding with AI leads to cascading errors as AI lacks project-wide context awareness. Every code change risks breaking existing functionality, necessitating thorough validation beyond manual checks.

### Challenges with Traditional Methods

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** demands upfront test creation for each task but becomes obsolete if specs change during AI iterations.

- **CI/CD pipelines** verify basic code execution but miss usability/functionality issues.

- Manual regression testing grows unmanageable as projects scale, especially with AI agents generating parallel code streams.

### Test

Sprite MCP Solution
This tool integrates your PRD (with user stories/goals) and codebase to auto-generate context-aware tests:

- **Workflow**: Upload PRD → Configure parameters (e.g., ports, test accounts) → AI generates tests → Runs in secure env → Delivers:

- Visual failure recordings

- Error logs

- Pass/fail reports

- Fix suggestions for AI agents

- **Integration**: Works with MCP-enabled IDEs (Cursor, VS Code) via API keys.

### Practical Benefits

- Catches unexpected breaks (e.g., backend APIs failing after UI tweaks)
- Reduces manual QA time by automating regression tests

- Preserves project-wide context via PRD linkage, unlike isolated AI self-tests

### Implementation Tip
Pair Test

Sprite with **PRD-driven development** (as shown in prior videos) for maximum efficiency in detecting and resolving AI coding errors.

## Context

As AI-generated code becomes mainstream, uncaught errors can derail production deployments. Developers and teams using AI coding tools (like Git

Hub Copilot or autonomous agents) need automated testing solutions to maintain reliability. Test

Sprite addresses this gap by leveraging project documentation to simulate human QA, critical for shipping robust applications in fast-paced AI development workflows.
