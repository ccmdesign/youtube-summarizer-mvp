  "fullText": "If you're tired of getting boring vanilla UIs like this from your AI workflows and instead want something that looks and feels super professional and is actually surprisingly straightforward to make, well then do I have good news for you. Because all you need to do is stop skipping one critical piece of the planning process, which is exactly what most builders do. They jump straight into the AI coding piece, but every minute saved by not planning ends up being 10 minutes down the line of extra work that needs to be done to help make something like this not look like crap. And so skipping this stage is why these apps tend to look super generic and put people to sleep. So I built a clawed skill to help fix this, and I'm going to give you access to it. But first, let's build the first piece of the puzzle. So, step number one is creating the PRD. And this is the thing that most people do. Do do get it? So, this is where we define the features, talk about how they're really meant to be used. So, this is where we define the features, talk about how they're really meant to be used, who the target users are, what the general flow kind of should be, what is the success criteria. How do we know that we built a thing that's actually doing what it is meant to do? And the thing is from here, you typically can actually build something that technically works. And so this is what most people do. They're going to take something like this. They're just going to throw it into clawed planning mode and say, \"Hey, go build this thing.\" And if they're feeling super spicy, they might work something in here that says like, \"And hey, give me a few pointers about the UX while you're doing it.\" So, in order to actually create this PRD, we can use a really basic command. I have one here. It'll be below the video. But basically, all we need in order for this thing to actually work is just some sort of documentation about what our MVP is. So, in this case, I'm giving a concept for what this app is. So, I'm actually adding in a pretty big new feature to an existing app, and it's basically a kind of N8N like interface. So, it's going to be a drag and drop builder with nodes that you can connect into things, have branching logic, all of that type of stuff, but there's a few unique things that is going to be inside of it. And so, I'm just prompting like what is the core concept really here of what we are building and then what are the main flows or steps or features that I'm thinking about in this thing. And so, this is where you can come in and just dump out what you're thinking of for this app. Now once we have this, I put it in a markdown file inside of the project. This one is called MVP.markdown. And then all we're going to do is we are going to go into cloud code and we're going to run this custom slash command. So we're going to say demo prd and then we are just going to give it the context of this specific file. So we could copy the path is one way to do it. And then we're just going to say go. And from here it's going to generate for us this PRD that we just looked at. So this is great because again it is our starting point. We need to have some tangible definition of like what is the thing actually that we are going to build in detail right some degree of detail. But if we were to really like think about this there's actually a ton of ambiguity in terms of how we would actually do this. And that ambiguity is how we end up with something like this. Because while it is functional, we're saying, \"Hey, we have these nodes. These nodes connect together and they pass data in this way, that's not really enough to build out a user experience that feels really good because any given problem, if you were to really think about it, has dozens, if not hundreds or thousands of different potential ways to solve that problem. As an example, if you were to think of a tool like chatbt or claude, they didn't need to make it a chat interface, right? They didn't need it to be an interface where you could come in and send messages through and get messages back. They could have made it so that you fill out a form and they email you back with what the LLM said, but that would probably be a user experience, right? And so, this is what we're trying to do. We're trying to think through how do we actually want someone to experience this thing in detail. So if that's the case, well then our next step becomes defining that experience. And this is the step that most people skip. So, when I first started thinking about like how to code well and build stuff with AI, as someone that had coded a fair amount before, but was not a trained software engineer, what my mind immediately went to was, well, how does a world-class product organization actually build stuff? And can I just try to mimic that process? So, if I were to interview the top 10 engineering leads from the best companies in the world or the top 10 product design leads from the best companies in the world and I said, \"Hey, teach me every single step about what goes into building a great product, what would they actually answer and can I codify that and put it into a process?\" Or if I asked them, \"How would you build the worst product in the world?\" Then maybe just do the opposite of whatever that was. And so, as it turns out with product design, there's actually some pretty standard stuff that everyone would pretty much agree you need to consider that thing and work it into your plan before you start building out actual features. And so, I've built some of these things into a claude skill, which you can get below the video. So, let's talk about what some of these things actually are. The first pass is mental model alignment. What does the user think is happening or think should be happening as they approach this feature? This is why it's important to actually research your ideal user and try to put yourself in their shoes with respect to the problem your app solves. What do they actually think should happen as they load up your app and try to solve that problem? Second pass, information architecture. what actually exists inside of the app and how is it all organized? So, what are all of the different pieces of information or context or concepts that someone is going to actually encounter inside of this app? And how are you going to choose to actually show them that information? Affordance and action. This is something that I think a lot of people skip over. How are you going to make the actions people can actually take clear to them? What actually looks clickable? What looks editable? What looks like it should generate you an output? What looks like something that a person should be aware of that this thing is actually going on as they interact with your app. So, we go through all of these types of questions in stages thinking through like they kind of build upon each other, right? Because how someone chooses to think about how the app should work to solve their problem is going to inform how we choose to present them information, which is going to inform how we choose to show them what information they can actually take action on, which then informs each subsequent stage down to how the system talks back to them. How does it interact depending on if the screen is empty, if it's loading, if there's a bunch of data in there, if there's incomplete data, if there's an error. We need to think through all of these things ahead of time because if we don't, the language model is going to make those decisions at game time and they love to cut corners. So what's going to end up happening is that they just don't do it at all. So again, what we can do here is we can just manually invoke this skill and it looks like this. So in this case, again, we're manually invoking it, which technically you should configure it. So, this could be automated, but for demo purposes, I'm going to manually call it. Use this PRD skill to translate that PRD that we made into our actual UX. And when we hit enter on this thing, it's going to run through. It's going to process it and out the other side, we're going to get an actual UX specification. So, this is following that structure that we just showed in our skill. So, we're thinking about the actual mental model that a user has as they approach this thing and how this needs to be reinforced through our actual UX decisions. We start thinking about the actual information architecture. What are all of the things like the actual elements and concepts that a user is going to encounter in this app? And so, again, this is all based on our PRD which was based on that MVP. So, we're going to have concepts like canvases, nodes, triggers, actions, connections between them. We're going to have a sidebar. We're going to have all of these other things that are specific to this app. And this is important to know because then we have to think through, well, how are we going to display this all to them in a cohesive way? And so, again, we're going through and we're grouping all of this together and talking about like, well, what shows where. So for example, if we are in the the node sidebar, which the node is one of our concepts, what are all of the different subconcepts and how are we going to choose to progressively show these things to people? And so we just repeat this process now for all of our UX decisions. So like we talked about earlier, needs to be really clear, like there need to be clear visual signals about what someone can actually do. So to take a really basic example of that, if we're going to tell people they can pick something out of the UI, we need to like indicate to them that that's actually something they can do. They're not just going to know that that's something that can happen. We need to be specific about making that clear to them. So again, this process repeats and repeats and repeats for all of the major features that we had inside of our PRD. But the problem now becomes this. If we were to simply take something like this or take our PRD and this and send it into a tool like Google Stitch or Replet Designer or one of those tools, they're actually pretty bad at handling this much context at the same time. And so we need now a system that can translate what we have just built into something that's going to work for those tools. So again we have another skill here you can run and this is the last skill in this sequence where effectively what we are doing is taking all of these features and the UX details and turning it into an actual build order. So if we wanted to actually properly capture all of those details and build through in stages, what would that actually need to look like? what would that sequence of events and what would basically the prompts be that we're going to paste into these tools. And so that is what this skill does. And after we run it through, we get out this build order document. Okay, so we have this big document that is specifying the entire build sequence from the creation of the design tokens through to the layout and then all of the details in between. Now again, all of these skills will be below the video. If you have a specific tool that you want to build with, I would recommend coming in and trying to tailor it to that platform's best practices. So, for example, with a tool like Google Stitch, you need to either be very vague or incredibly [snorts] specific. And so, you might want to come in here if you want to use this with Stitch and have Claude Code update this skill so that it's specific for your use case. The version I have here is adequate to work across all of the different tools, but obviously as specific as we can get with the tools we're working with, it can become more and more polished and better to use. So, all we're going to do now is we are going to go prompt by prompt and just paste each of these into the tool one by one. So, I'm going to start at the top and then make my way down. So, there's a lot of tools you can use to mock this type of stuff up. You have Google Stitch, which I ran it through. You can use a tool like Replet's designer mode. There's there's tons of different tools that you can use for this stuff. I am going to be using a tool called Polyat. And the reason I'm using this tool is that I I honestly think, especially if you want like a functional prototype, I think it's one of the best tools out there. I do not get paid from these guys. I do not have an affiliate link. it. It's just a really good tool and I really like it which is why this is what I use. But again, you can use any tool that you think works well for your workflows and you have a good system of working with. So again, we [snorts] are going to come through here. I'm actually going to start with the prompt layout shell. Okay. So what we're going to do is we're just going to make the base kind of navigational feel and layout structure of this thing. So I'm going to copy that prompt. I'm going to come in here and all I'm going to do is paste it in. So I am going to just use one of their public design systems they have. So like button colors and things like that are already going to be there. I have this pasted in and all I'm going to do is hit go and then I will pause and we will look at what the first output is. All right guys, so what we got out the other side is again a really basic starting point. Okay, so we have our main canvas here, just the layout. Most of this functionality probably doesn't work cuz I haven't told it what I want yet. We have like basic configuration stuff on here, but we haven't even prompted what our UX is for that yet. So really basic builder. What I'm going to do now is I'm just going to go through and all I'm going to do is copy each of these prompts one by one and paste them in to this system. So we're going to go one by one. Going to paste them all in. And then I will unpause once this process is done. Nothing secret happening off the screen. It's just this is probably going to take about 20 minutes and so not worth us sitting here all just staring at that process. So I'm going to go through I'm going to start pasting all these in and then we will look at the final product. So there we go. Process is done. And I got to say I think it looks really professional. Again remember this is going to be one view inside of a larger application that I have. But we have now all of these triggers, we have the actions, we have some conditional like logic and control. And we have even some different data sources that we can configure. All really nicely organized and grouped together. I can drag different items onto the canvas. I can I think draggy I can drag around which is pretty cool. I can zoom in, zoom out. All really nice. If I was to pop into one of these, again, we have some really nice formatting. It all feels super cohesive. If I was to look into one of these nodes, we can kind of pick our models out. Um, we can see some of these like signals, right, of what the user can do in the app. So, if I were to come through here now, I could type in these double brackets and boom, I get this nice dropdown where I could select something out of my knowledge base. Inserts it in there nicely. What else do we have in here? We can come through. We have this little assistant at the bottom which we can pop out and probably chat with which is pretty cool. If we hit run workflow, we get this really nice like kind of loading animation showing that like information is passing between the nodes. So all in all, like it it feels really nice. And again, if we were to pop in and actually look at some of these nodes, it just everything feels like it's in a spot where it's meant to be and that there's a reason why it's there. I can come in, I can add conditions, I can map fields from other places in the UI. If I were to come in and say I want to add in like I don't know a YouTube video as a data source. See where that went? If I was to click on this now, we see the YouTube name pops out. Uh we can give the video. We can say what we want to do. We want to extract comments. We want to attract transcript. Do we want to include timestamps? Again, all like really, really nice, right? There's like a lot of detail in this. And again, that's because we planned it out first. We planned out all of this detail ahead of time, which meant when we went to the building process, we had a ton of specificity about what we wanted and we didn't have vagueness. And when you have vagueness, this is the type of thing that you get. And for most people, this is what their experience building with AI actually looks like and feels like. They have a cool concept, but then they get out something like this that just like kind of feels vanilla, right? It kind of feels vanilla. It's like it's cool. I could show it to my friends. I'd probably use it and it's functional, but it doesn't have the same pizzazz as something that we went through and thought about every little detail that was going to be in our build. And so, just to show you that I wasn't pulling any funny business by making this intentionally poor, what we did was we created a PRD. We actually took the same exact PRD that we had from the other project. We pasted it in in planning mode inside of Claude with a basic vanilla Nex.js application with Tailwind and we told it we wanted to clone the aesthetic of Claude. And then we gave it again all of those same that literally identical PRD and said, \"Hey, I need you to go build this thing, right? I need you to go build this thing and build it with mock data.\" So I don't need you to build any of the backend functionality. Just build this thing with mock data. And so now you can see what the difference is between those types of approaches. So if you liked this process, I will link a video right here, which is where we actually plan out apps like this in extreme detail if you're serious about wanting to build cool stuff that actually works with AI workflows. You can adapt a lot of the stuff that we just did in this video to that process. Check that one out if you are interested. But that is it for this video. I will see you in the next",
