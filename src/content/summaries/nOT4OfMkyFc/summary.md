## Key Takeaways

This recipe focuses on creating a dense, nutritious dessert using whole food substitutes for traditional baking ingredients.

* **Flour Replacement**: Rolled oats ground into a fine powder and soaked in hot milk provide the structure without the need for processed wheat.

* **Natural Sweetening**: The recipe relies on **mashed banana**, dried fruits (raisins and prunes), and natural sweeteners like honey or stevia to avoid refined sugar.

* **Stovetop Baking**: Utilizing a **frying pan on low heat** for 20 minutes eliminates the need for an oven, making it accessible for any kitchen setup.

* **Textural Layering**: Placing **apple slices and walnuts** at the bottom of the pan creates a caramelized fruit-and-nut topping when the cake is flipped.

## Summary

### Preparation of the Base
The process begins by transforming **100g (1 cup) of rolled oats** into a fine flour using a grinder or blender. This oat flour is mixed with **3 tablespoons of cocoa powder** and **180ml of hot milk**. This mixture is covered and left to sit for **15 minutes**. This hydration step is crucial as it softens the oats, ensuring the final cake has a smooth, cake-like texture rather than a grainy or chewy consistency.

### Incorporating Wet Ingredients
While the oats soak, the liquid base is prepared by whisking **two eggs** and blending them with a **ripe banana** and a sweetener of choice, such as honey, maple syrup, or stevia. Once the oat mixture has thickened, the egg and banana blend is folded in. To enhance the flavor profile and nutritional value, the recipe adds **soaked raisins**, **finely chopped prunes**, and **1 teaspoon of baking soda** to provide the necessary lift during the cooking process.

### Pan Arrangement and Cooking
The cooking process happens entirely on the stovetop. A frying pan is greased with **1 tablespoon of coconut oil** (or lined with baking paper if the pan is not non-stick). A decorative and flavorful base is created by arranging **thinly sliced apples** and **chopped walnuts** across the bottom. The chocolate batter is poured evenly over the fruit. The pan is covered and placed on **low heat for 20 minutes**. This slow, enclosed cooking method steams the top of the cake while gently caramelizing the apples at the bottom.

### Finishing Touches and Glaze
To finish the dessert, a simple **healthy chocolate glaze** is prepared by combining **1/3 cup milk**, **2 tablespoons of cocoa**, and **1/2 tablespoon of coconut oil**. This is drizzled over the warm cake. The final result is a moist, nutrient-dense chocolate treat that is high in fiber and healthy fats, often served alongside herbal tea with lemon and honey. The recipe demonstrates that sophisticated, healthy desserts can be achieved with minimal equipment and whole-food ingredients.

## Context

This recipe reflects the growing 'clean eating' trend, targeting individuals who seek to avoid gluten and refined sugars without sacrificing dessert. It addresses the increasing demand for 'stovetop baking,' a method popular among those with limited kitchen appliances or those looking to save energy compared to traditional oven use. By substituting processed flour with oats and using fruit for sweetness, it aligns with dietary preferences for high-fiber and low-glycemic index foods. This approach is particularly relevant for fitness enthusiasts, home cooks interested in healthy snack alternatives, and those following specific dietary restrictions who still want accessible, indulgent-tasting food.
