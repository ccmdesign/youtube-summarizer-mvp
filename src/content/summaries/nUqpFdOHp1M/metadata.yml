title: "DeepSeek-V3.2: How Open Source Just Caught Up with GPT-5"
description: >-
  DeepSeek-V3.2 has officially dropped, and it is rewriting the rules for Open
  Source LLMs. 🚀

  In this deep dive, we break down how DeepSeek's new "Sparse Attention" (DSA)
  architecture and massive Reinforcement Learning scaling allow it to rival
  GPT-5 and match Gemini 3.0 Pro in reasoning and coding tasks. We analyze the
  specific engineering breakthroughs that made this possible and what developers
  can learn from their agentic workflows.


  In this video, we cover:

  🔹 The Architecture: How DSA achieves linear complexity and breaks the
  quadratic barrier.

  🔹 The Training: Why allocating over 10% of compute to Post-Training RL is the
  new standard.

  🔹 The Agents: How a "Synthetic Data Factory" created Gold-Medal coding
  agents.

  🔹 The Blueprint: Practical lessons on Context Management and "Cold Start"
  prompting for your apps.


  If you are an AI engineer or developer, you need to understand the mechanics
  inside this paper.
