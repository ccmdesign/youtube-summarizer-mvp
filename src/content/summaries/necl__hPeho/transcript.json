  "fullText": "Welcome to the explainer. Today we are diving deep into the world of AI assisted coding. We're going to look at a methodology that's designed to take that sometimes unpredictable chaotic process and turn it into a reliable systematic workflow. So if you've ever spent hours working with a large language model on a really complex coding task, this quote it probably hits a little too close to home. You get these incredible moments of brilliance, but then the second you hit a context limit or just change your focus, it feels like all that progress just evaporates. It's like you have to start over every single time. And that right there is the heart of the AI coding headache. You know, your work gets chopped up into pieces. There's no real systematic way to tackle big features. And those super important quality checks, they often get missed. All that amazing context you built up with the AI, it just disappears. But what if what if you could take all that chaos and turn it into a system that's predictable and, you know, reliable? Well, that's exactly the promise of this workflow. It introduces a structured approach specifically designed to fix these exact problems. Now, this isn't just a handful of commands. It's a complete four-phase workflow. You've got explore, plan, execute, and ship. And the really important thing here is that each phase builds directly on the one before it, creating this clear, logical path from a vague idea all the way to production ready code. Okay, so let's break this down starting right at the beginning with phase one exploration. You could argue this is the most critical step of all because it sets the foundation for everything that comes after. The goal here is actually pretty simple, but it's incredibly powerful. You let the AI do all the initial heavy lifting. It goes in, analyzes your requirements, scans the entire codebase, and flags any potential roadblocks, and it documents everything it finds in a superdetailed file called exploration.md. So for our example, let's say we want to add user authentication. We would just kick the whole thing off with this simple /explore command. The AI then just gets right to work analyzing our whole project to understand the full context of what we're asking for. All right, now we get to phase two, the plan. This is where that initial deep dive analysis from the exploration phase gets turned into a real actionable blueprint. And this is the really cool part. The output from the explore phase becomes the direct input for the plan phase. The system literally takes that exploration.mmd file and uses it to break the entire project down into these ordered verifiable steps. Nothing gets lost in translation. The command couldn't be simpler. You just type /pl. That's it. The system automatically pulls in all the findings from that exploration phase and generates a superdetailed blueprint for the entire feature. And let's be clear, this is not just some simple to-do list. We're talking about a comprehensive implementation plan. It's got task dependencies, really specific success criteria, even risk analysis. This becomes the exact map that the AI is going to follow to the letter. So with our solid plan totally locked in, we can move from the blueprint to the actual building. Welcome to phase 3, execute. This is where the code gets written, but in a really systematic and verifiable way. This is where the whole process really starts to shine. Instead of getting one massive scary block of code dropped on you, we use the /next command. This tells the AI, hey, let's tackle this plan one task at a time. Each little step is implemented, it's verified, and only then is it safely committed. So every time you run /next, the AI just picks up the very next task from our plan. It writes the code, it runs the tests, and only when everything passes does it commit the changes with a nice, clear, descriptive message. And you just keep running next, next. It's that simple. The system just moves through the task list in the right order, tracking everything as it goes. You get this really clear, visual update on your progress with every single command. Okay, once every single task in the plan is marked as complete, we hit the final stage, phase four, ship. This is all about delivering highquality, well doumented and productionready code with total confidence. Think of the ship command as that final quality gate. It packages everything up, runs all the final checks, and can even automatically generate a pull request for your team to review, complete with a detailed summary of all the work that's been done. This checklist is the perfect picture of the built-in safety net we're talking about. The system actually verifies that every task is done, all the tests are passing, and the documentation is up to date before anything gets delivered. It basically guarantees that what you ship is exactly what you planned. So, at the end of the day, this is the transformation we're talking about. You're moving away from that chaotic, forgetful process on the left to the structured, auditable workflow on the right. A system where context and quality are protected through the entire development cycle. You see, a methodology like this fundamentally changes how you work with an AI. It takes it from being that brilliant but forgetful assistant and turns it into a systematic, reliable partner. The AI handles the step-by-step execution, which frees you up to focus on the bigger picture, the architecture. So, it leaves you with a final question to think about. What could you build if your AI partner never forgot the plan?",
