description: >-

  revenue models across knowledge work. Tailwind's mass layoffs and Stack

  traffic and paid conversions. Potential fixes include corporate sponsorships,
  platform acquisitions, enterprise integrations, and built-in token
  contributions to sustain open-source digital infrastructure.
