  "fullText": "All right, Kip. I'm scrolling in X today and uh to my surprise, there's a new launch of a marketing agent that's got a lot of negative reaction. And I think one of the reasons it's got a bunch of negative reaction is when people look at it, there's two real takeaways that people are having. First, wow, marketing sucks. Is this really what marketers do? Oh my god, like these people are going to ruin the internet. And then the second one is the AI is really going to ruin the internet. So I want to give you a little bit of a introduction to this and get your take. There's a company called Astral and they had a launch and the a they have a launch and it's basically a marketing agent that allows you to do commenting at scale. So it will go off and it will say hey like you're interested in this and your audience are interested in these things and it creates a bunch of agents and then goes comments for you on LinkedIn. It goes comments for you and it go makes the comments on uh Reddit and it goes and actually gets a bunch of comments that you can go and do at scale and when you actually watch it you're like if you're not a marketer you're like Jesus is this marketing is this what marketers do? >> This is brutal. I watched >> this is horrible. What are you all doing with your time? >> This is like automating spam. >> Yeah. Are we paying you? Are we paying marketer? Wait, am I paying my marketers? Is this what they're doing? they're just going out and spamming Reddit and LinkedIn >> mindlessly commenting on all these threads. Uh, as someone who has been like a victim of AI common at scale on LinkedIn, um, I have to be really honest, I do hate this use of AI. I've been very very vocal >> about that. And there's also the the problem that if we go to a world where AI is creating content, AI is distributing content, AI is commenting on its own content, then we are in a dystopian future where the real essence of the web uh that really helped marketing I think get elevated and create value for people is being eroded and killed and you and I do not want that to happen. Well, the second you outsource conversations to robots completely, the robots are just going to go back and forth to each other and like then it's just going to become unusable to humans, right? Because you're just going to have these competing robots saying what they think and oh okay well this means nothing now. Now now there's this whole thread of stuff that fundamentally means nothing. Someone starts the the AI starts a thread and it's like hello humans I uh have this question about this product or service and then another agent comes and comments goes hello human that's a very interesting question and that's what the web is so let me show you so why why do people uh why do people really hate this I think uh first of all I I think that there's this like this is a midmarketing tool I think the problem is this is the lowest level stuff I think they're they're right with that and again I'm not trying to we're not trying to we're trying to talk about like why did this have such negative reaction, right? And I think it's because like this is not actually marketing to be honest with you. This is not how I've ever thought about my role or have ever spent any time doing this, right? I think do we have people who participate in conversations in community? Yes, that is part of your brand. That is not something you outsource. But there's another one here that I want to uh quickly show you. First of all, they also did something that I would really recommend them if they want to go down this path not to do. I and I've also done this publicly. I've talked about it publicly. I don't think a brand a great brand message right now is replace jobs. That's what they're leading with. >> It's just not a people are not going to get excited about your brand, right? Like I don't think that's that's an exciting comment. But uh this person here, this is maybe one uh I would argue it's not even 1%. >> Yeah, it's like 1,000 of a real marketer. And I'd actually don't even know that it's a real marketer. >> It's it's not. This is not marketing. This one here, right? The dead internet theory is coming through. >> True. What's the dead internet theory? It means that all this spam is just going to >> blow up over the internet and the internet's going to become unusable. >> Uh, okay. So, let's let's just have one more comment and jump into it. So, I understand this is the world we're heading toward. Little we can do about it. Pros and cons. I'm just devastated that our online experiences are going to be 90% AI generated and it will be harder to distinguish from human generated content. It's a serious loss. I think this is what we're talking about. Yeah, the issue >> is is uh how we can create and craft things that humans are interested in. And what we're seeing there are tools that are telling you to and again I actually would not even put comedant in what marketers do but let's just say comments for the sake of this uh uh conversation is like a tiny part of what a marketer crafts participates. Outsourcing the entire thing to AI feels like completely the wrong thing to do. And I just don't think this is the kind of things that marketers should be doing. >> Look, AI content is everywhere right now. And most of it is total garbage. It's loweffort, generic, and frankly obvious. But AI isn't the problem. Bad prompts are. We built a system with 20 prompts that keep your content human. ideation, creation, distribution, optimization, the whole thing. Get it right now. Scan the QR code or click the link in the description. Now, uh let's get back to the show. I am you you shared this with me ahead of the show and you and I both like we used a lot of expletives back and forth on WhatsApp about how ridiculous and wrong a lot of this is. Uh before we kind of talk about that, we just want to we just want to show you the first, >> right? Let's let's uh give a little bit of the launch video. And again, this is just our take on marketing and to give you a little bit of like what our core beliefs are. And we're not trying to like rag on the >> founder. No disrespect to the founder who made this video. It's more about the underlying premise of what she's talking about the product doing is just we fundamentally disagree with. >> You're looking at a network of AI agents working together so that one person can outperform a team of 10. Let me show you how it works using a Tif. Aif is the founder of Capital Stack, an investor outreach app with no customers. But we're going to use Astral to get him his first 10. >> So I will say uh this product is definitely aimed at early stage founders. So I want to make sure they're get their due here that it's like really focused on early stage founders who do not really have any marketers and have no real resources. >> I'll ask Ash to pull fundraising posts from Reddit and LinkedIn and draft comments that drive leads to his product. Now watch what happens next. >> I cannot even say how much I despise automating comments. I know I've said that all this year. >> Commenting on posts is a deeply deeply human thing to do. It's like part of the real essence of the web is bringing folks together so they can conversate on all of these different shared interests. And I just feel like it's such a horrible dystopian thing to automate as like an agent create content and an agent comments on the content. Well, that that's that I think that's the issue. It's not just like, oh, well, I h I'm going to I have this idea and I want this agent to go and post it for me. It's like the agent's coming up with that this idea. It's posting it and then other agents are going to keep doing it. And what's what you're going to have is just like an endless thread of LinkedIn comments or Reddit comments from all the companies using this automation source and it's going to be completely unusable. >> You already have this on LinkedIn by the way. All everyone who I like I'm on LinkedIn a lot. I like posting content on LinkedIn and I hate the uh the agent comments. They've actually decreased a little bit over time because everyone got sick of them and we're like calling them out. But I'm going to keep going here. >> First, the AI team lead kicks off the task and spins up a full team of specialists. It pulls everything it knows about a his voice, his product, his story. Next, two research agents dive in. One uses Reddit's API for recent fundraising posts and the other browses LinkedIn for the same. Then the content lead steps in not to write but to brief two expert copyright. >> By way I think the uh research stuff here is actually cool a cool use of AI for a busy founder research in which which are like good communities to participate in researching um you know what are good topics that your audience are interested in all pretty good uses of AI. We've long been a huge fan of AI for research. >> It's that research to do shitty spammy stuff that's the problem. >> Yeah. And we're going to show a couple of examples of that in a future show in a in a very future show of how we would use a a version of research to do actually really incredible marketing. >> One for Reddit and one for LinkedIn. Now, these aren't generic AI writers. They know what lands, what converts, and exactly how to sound like a teeth. >> Oh, pause, pause, pause. >> These are not generic AI writers. This is what lands and what's converts. You don't [ __ ] land and convert things in Reddit and LinkedIn. >> This is like community engagement, community management. This is not >> like you you will get black ballalled from Reddit if you're trying to convert people in Reddit comments. >> Well, plus Reddit is a community, >> right? >> You don't go there to convert. It's like >> I guess what I'm saying is if you jump into a Reddit thread and you're like writing conversion Yeah. Like this is like the core problem with >> Hi humans, I am here to answer your question. I'm going to give you this free thing that you think is awesome. >> Um I will tell you that um I think I have spent more time in how to craft content with AI assistance than any human possible over the past year >> and uh you can hund you can hund I would never recommend having an AI autonomously create content on your behalf. create a first draft that you add to make better add your own >> as a code or an editor. It's great. >> Yeah. >> Not as a you can 100% tell when AI has crafted content >> human sounding comments the kind that rise to the top when human sounding com why we shouldn't HAVE TO HAVE HUMAN SOUNDING COMMENTS. >> Why do we have like I don't know why are we is anyone like are we getting excited about this? You can make these things sound like a human. It's a It's a community, >> but that is the essence of the web. But also, build your tribe. Have a community. In this world, it doesn't need even need to sound like a human because it's all going to be bots just talking to each other. >> It's going to be bots talking to each bots create the content. Bots talk to each other. Humans update then. What is the point? >> Replies. But we're not done yet. We're going for perfection. Let's head to the review studio, which is your control center as the human at the center of an AI marketing team. Everything the agents created is waiting here in your inbox and you can efficiently process all of the content in your editor. You know, this last paragraph ends abruptly. Let's ask the chat to tie it back to the opening anecdote. >> Oh god. So you can I think that's like kind of cool actually. You can have an inbox for agents, but you then tell the agent through an a command line to change the content. >> I will say um uh like I you do not need to learn content to participate in the community. You should just participate naturally. I will tell crafted crafting content is going to be a timely skill to learn. Do not outsource that to agents and have agents craft your content on your behalf. >> Well, I kind of I cannot emphasize that enough. >> And Kieran, I guarantee >> you could have this agent write a 100 comments and you could go write 100 comments yourself and the engagement conversion rate on what you're going to do is going to be so much higher. But this isn't marketing. I guess my whole point is like if this is what we believe marketing is, then we fundamentally dis we fundamentally don't really understand what marketing truly is. And marketing is not like how do I uh comment at scale across lots of communities. Uh marketing is like how do you build a tribe? How do you like deeply understand? >> How do I get somebody talking about me? How do I do something remarkable? How do I actually be worthy? Because I've done something other than like ask an AI bot to go automate some [ __ ] >> And if you're a busy founder, build your brand. I cannot We've talked about personality growth. Like actually build your brand. have if you are not a good content creator, have a really great content creator talk to you. Understand your points of view of things like your takes on things and craft that into great content. Do not have an agent do that on your behalf. It just we these things will not stand the test of time. And I think the thing we're we uh the thing that got us fired up is like we don't like there's some like the research part cool. But if we really believe the future is going to be a bunch of agents creating content and comment on each other's content, then like we may as well just opt out of all this because this is the other thing we were going to show what like what what is the future then? Well, the future is going to be similar to what happened to Stack Over overflow. Like Stack Overflow used to be an incredible place where people did ask questions and people did answer questions. give everybody a little background about like what what Stack Overflow is so that there's context around this. >> So Stack Overflow is a Q&A community for developers. It was like the biggest of its time. Uh it had a ton of incredible knowledge there. You used to go there, ask question, get it answered. People participated like a real community and then chat ingested all of that information and you could get it through AI and then it killed the community. And that's bad for AI because there's no more content being created that it can actually train on. So it's actually bad for the AI, but it's really bad for the web because now you have a really valuable thing that used to exist not exist anymore. So imagine this tool, it becomes the ubiquitous tool of how we do marketing. What happens to Reddit? You have agents creating the threads and agents uh commenting on the threads. I'm sure Reddit actually have some ways to actually figure out uh over time what what's being automated and and kill all those things. But like this is not a this is not a fun future, right? This is first of all, I don't believe that this is marketing. I believe that this is common at scale. >> And the second thing is I don't know if this is what we should spend our time trying to do. I don't think automating comments with AI is a valuable use of AI. It is the lowest form of anything that you could do to automate. It's just like automating automating something that should not be automated. Uh if you don't have time to participate in in Reddit, you shouldn't participate in Reddit. If you don't have time to show up as yourself in these communities, you shouldn't show up in these communities, right? Like that. That would be my take on it. I don't know how you feel about that, but I just don't think that this is a good direction for marketing tools to go. And I also think it paints marketing in a really shitty light. It paints marketing as like, oh, this is what marketers do. They sit there all day trying to get as many comments as they can on communities, right? Uh, and just try to do it at scale. I don't >> want to be associated with this. >> Do you? >> No. I I don't I don't see anything to do in my job in in in a tool like that. Um, again, I'm not trying to rag on the founders, but I just don't think this is how we we as marketeteers show up and do great work. >> Yeah. It's not about that product or that video. It's that video is an example of what could go really wrong and what could fundamentally just make marketing ineffective and not really exist as a profession and that's not I feel like you and I have spent our whole lives doing marketing and we really love it and we don't want to see it go down this really bad path and also Kieran has there ever been a company in the world that you are know you know of that is like automated their storytelling and outreach completely and actually built a real brand and actually not seen as some like shitty commoditized spammer. >> No. No. You don't build a brand that way. I guess if you're like a small business and you're just trying to sell some affiliate products and you're like, \"Hey, I just want to make some dollars.\" Then, you know, maybe automating some of this stuff at crazy scale is like fine because you're you're right in a couple of years. But if you want to build a real long-lasting brand, you have to show up. You have to participate. You have to have personality. You have to craft things people are interested in. Can you use AI to assist you in doing these things? Yes. But if you're going to outsource your marketing, this again, this isn't marketing. This is commenting. If you're going to outsource, but participate in communities to AI, I think we've misunderstood what the value of marketing and the web inherently is. >> Yeah. So, so for example, uh I don't know when it's going to come out, but you and I just did a recorded a show with PJ Ace, who is this awesome, uh creative and uses AI video tools to build amazing commercials and tell stories for brands. To me, that's an amazing example of using AI because he's got this really great story that he can now tell faster, cheaper, and more contextual ways because of this new technology. >> But they are still crafting and making this beautiful story. It's just being told without the need of doing a huge production shoot and all of these like slow and expensive things like that's amazing and and you all when it comes out check out that episode. This is the opposite of that and a lot of the technology and marketing is the opposite of that which is like I want to outsource my marketing thinking and I don't want to have to do or really think about marketing. I just want to like message enough people that a small fraction will respond back to me. You know who does that? Spammers. Like that's like like that's the business model for like the terrible spammers out there. And it's like do you like do you want to go to bed at night like feeling that way about yourself? Right. I don't >> like uh no. Uh yeah. Like in Reddit you're turning up and the comment is, \"Hello, I am a prince.\" Can you imagine like going home and telling >> at the airport? Could you go could you imagine going home and telling your daughter that you're like, \"Oh, yeah. Had to set had to set up my 60th Reddit account today because the first 59 have been black ballalled and uh I I've got five proxy servers because they've banned me across all these IP addresses. Why come?\" >> You're s you're sitting at you're s you're sitting at the dinner and you're like, \"What what do you do?\" Oh, you know, I'm a I'm a v you know I create videos for Hollywood. I create trailers. I craft things. What do you do? Oh, I like I design fashion catwalks for all these incredible things. What do you do? Well, I'm a marketer. Wow. Like what what do you do? Uh, well, today I created 60 agents and they all commented on things on LinkedIn and Reddit. That's pretty cool, right? Everyone's like, \"Leave. I contributed to the downfall of the internet.\" >> But in all seriousness, it's it's a concern that >> like you and I are laughing, but we're recording the show because we actually are genuinely concerned. I do not I I I I want AI and the way I talk about it and you talk about it and we talk about it online is to be a renaissance from marketers to be crafts people and so the I would >> explain that explain what that means so that people really understand what I >> I would say marketers like PJ is a good example he is a true uh domain expert on that video like he crafts incredible videos that are engaging that you want to watch but he uses AI tools to be able to do that in a shorter amount of time so he craft more things. He can craft more things because it costs less. It takes less time. He's less dependent upon other people. He's more autonomous. And so he can actually really craft more things of value for his customers. So if you take that tool, a better uh use for that founder would be a tool that offloads a lot of the other admin and mundane things he has to do so he can actually get the time to truly participate in these communities because that's a valuable thing to do. And I think what we want to see is marketeteers as crafts people who can craft more things that people are interested in consuming will find valuable. And the AI is assistant in the background to do those things to actually allow the marketer to do those things uh and be more autonomous and own them and create and craft more things, right? We don't want to see the AI just automate a bunch of like things that's average like it's going to automate average at scale, right? Just like I think what we're saying here, Kieran, is that everybody out there has a choice. If you're watching the show, you have a choice. You can either think about living in Florence, Italy in the 13,4s, 1500s and being a part of the Renaissance. And what happened in the Renaissance is new tools made it possible to build and craft new things or to craft things at a bigger and more interesting scale. And that's the world I want to live in. What we talked about today and what we're worried about is like the industrial revolution for marketing. like factories just making everything the exact same and just automating every last little bit so that there's no craft and no personality and nothing of remark that exists. And I know the industrial revolution side of this is going to seem tempting and interesting at times. It is the wrong path and it is the path path of shortterm gains for very long-term failure. Uh, and I think Kieran, you and I have thought about this a lot, and we are fully committed to the Renaissance. And actually, I think you and I personally feel like we're in a renaissance. We feel like we are making and building and crafting more than we ever have and see the potential for marketing if that's what actually happens, >> right? I think true craft has imperfections. AI does not know how to do those things. I think you should be uh you should uh celebrate those imperfections and how you bring them to life in your video content content creation craft things and uh I I this is uh this is I I'm sticking to that path and if we get beat by the automators then I think the internet is in like there's bigger problems in marketing dying >> if this happens the internet doesn't exist in any any valuable >> we live in a world where agents create the content agents distribute the content then agents comment in content uh from after reading the content, the human is going to opt out because that stuff is just going to be garbage. And you see it on Instagram. Uh there was a real problem in Instagram where people were like, I just this stuff is garbage. I don't want to be here anymore. People want to work with your company or you not because you have just have a good product at a fair price. They want to work with you because you believe something because they think you're going to be a good partner because they want to be a part of something bigger than themselves. And you can't communicate any of those things through like automated comments and automated content creations and robots talking to robots and that's not what we want to have happen, right? So, please join us. >> Please join us on the Renaissance path. Please, please, please. >> And let's craft >> and just go into this next era of marketing doing the right thing. We need you to do it. We are going to do everything we can to do it. But we do not want the future to look like the glimpse we got today. >> This data is wrong every freaking time. >> Have you heard of HubSpot? >> HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated. >> Whoa. I can see the client's whole history. Calls, support tickets, emails, and here's a task from 3 days ago I totally missed. >> HubSpot. Grow better.",
