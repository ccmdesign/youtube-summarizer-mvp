title: Dessn - Is this the future of AI prototyping?
description: >-
  Gab (https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriella-hachem/) and Nim
  (https://www.linkedin.com/in/nim-cheema/) are the co-founders of a startup
  called Dessn (https://join.dive.club/dessn-content) which allows designers to
  prototype in the context of their production codebase (without any of the
  setup).


  So I asked them to hook it up to the Inflight (https://www.inflight.co/) repo
  and give me a little demo to see what’s possible.


  I’m pretty sold 👀


  Dive is where the best designers never stop learning 🤿
