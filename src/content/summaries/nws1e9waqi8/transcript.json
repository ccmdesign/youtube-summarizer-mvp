  "fullText": "There is no reason to have to ever leave production anymore. You you can just work in that environment. That tradeoff of speed and quality that we used to have to make, I think [music] doesn't exist anymore because it's so achievable. >> Welcome to Dive Club. My name is Rid and this is where designers never stop learning. [music] Today's episode is with Gabriella and Nim who are the co-founders of a new design tool called Desen. And the reason that I'm so interested in this product is they've built a way for designers to prototype within the context of your production codebase only without any of the setup costs. I had to see for myself. So I gave them access to the in-flight repo just to see what's possible and it's pretty compelling. So let's dive right in. So last week Kevin who's our founding design engineer, he shipped this awesome animation vial on Twitter. uh and as we ship that you know it's really really cool and I was working on a completely different feature and I was like I want to use this in my feature you know I was very inspired by it so what I did is I went into Dustin and the first thing I did is I said render the notification component and then what Dustin did is that it shows exactly what the component looks like and you know you can see that there's three different variants of this component that and I can choose that >> so I was like ah okay now I know how this kind of works and by the way this is pulling exactly one to one from the code. This is not a recreation of what he did. This is literally the you know onetoone code that he wrote and you know I was able to pull that through. So I didn't you know if I'm a designer on a team I didn't have to go to a dev to understand how to do this. I didn't have to like copy this in Figma and figure out how to do it. I just went in Dustin and said please show me this component and there it is. Right? So I was like this is pretty cool. I really want to look at the animations cuz I want to like use animations for my own path. So, the next thing I did is I asked Dustin to show me all the different ways this animation can work. >> Oh, cool. I saved all these on notion, by the way. I saw that tweet and I was like, \"Oh, that's amazing.\" And so, without even putting two and two together, I took screenshots and like saved the link and I was like, \"I'm going to reference this for something later. I don't even know what it is yet, but it's really cool.\" >> So, I'm like, I, you know, I want to figure out if I can make icons with this kind of animation. The next thing I asked Dustin to create me an animation playground. So this is what DS came out with. Uh this is an animation playground where I can basically let me load a preset and I can look at all these different uh animations and I can build. >> So for example I can do a straight line and then I can you know play play together with different settings and then make my own animations right. So I was really able to use this to kind of create my own icon. I was trying to make a lightning icon. I'm not very good at designing things by pixels but you know this is getting me quite closer and the awesome thing is this is literally just using den code and I'm just now able to you know play with it see different kind of animations and see how this fits in the feature I'm working on and at the end of the day all I have to do is go in the code view and you know I just copy paste the code and cursor and now I can use this animation all across my codebase I didn't have to go to dev as a non-technical designer I'm just able to play things that were shipped and finally thing is because Destin is always up to date with your codebase. So, you know, Kevin shipped this like few days ago and I was able to pull this in Dustin instantly and that's one of the big features that we have. You know, our code stays in sync with the design envir real quick message and then we can jump back into it. Don't be the person with the portfolio that doesn't have a custom domain. With Framer's latest release, you don't have that excuse anymore because they partnered with Hover to provide a seamless flow where you can select free or discounted domains that will automatically be connected to your Framer site after [music] purchase. You heard me right. Framer is offering free custom domains for the first year when you upgrade your site to a yearly plan. So definitely don't miss out on this offer. You can head to dive.comclub/framer to claim your domain today. There legitimately might not be a tool that the design industry agrees on more than Mobin. Over 1 million designers from companies like Airbnb, Uber, Headspace all use Mobin for design inspiration. [music] And it makes sense. It's one of the highest ROI investments that you can possibly make as a [music] designer. I use Mobin almost every single day to look at realworld examples of how different products handle specific UI patterns and flows. It's invaluable to my practice and I can't recommend the product enough. So head to dive.comclub/mobin to check it out today. That's m ob i n. Okay, now on to the episode. It's been a theme recently where people are using AI to create tools, but the starting point is always, you know, it's it's from scratch, right? you're you can make something amazing, but consistency and almost like world building within a brand at scale gets a little bit trickier, especially when you're trying to make it collaborative. But this is such a unique visual style and being able to just kind of point it at different areas and piggyback off of everything that's already in production is really really interesting. >> It's super powerful. There's so much context in production. We It's your source of truth of the product. It is objectively the single source of truth to your product. But access to that environment used to be blocked by a skill barrier. You had to know how to code to access prod. Um, and we take that effort all away and we give you prod on a plate and and you get to actually work and exist in that world, the same world as devs. >> We're looking at this from more of like, you know, visual animation. I really want to see, you know, where's the ceiling for actual prototyping because that's something that I've been thinking so much about and trying different things and you kind of always hit walls around like, okay, I'm using this oneoff prototyping tool, but I'm spending a lot of time recreating production. The amount of times that it starts with like a screenshot or maybe like a Figma frame and I'm like 80% of the way there. How does that work? Like that's what I really want to see because I feel like there's a real problem to be solved there. >> Yeah, I agree. Let's do it. So, we asked you before we started filming for some use cases, some very real in-flight use cases, your priorities. What are you actually working on in your day-to-day? So, you can see here we've compiled your codebase. And so, this is the in-flight environment. You have uh your components extracted and everything that you then do is in context of your repository. So, this was some one of the priorities that you shared with us. You wanted to create an interactive transcript component that can be triggered from the new playback controls component. We believe a lot in exploration in design. So this feature is a very B1 feature of this, but we just shipped variants. So you can see uh different options of designs. >> Oh, look that animation again. >> Yeah, >> I love that animation. The whole motif you have with like the kind of I don't even know what you would call that indent. It's really nice. >> I haven't cooked with it. Yeah. Okay. So, we have variance going. First output does take time. We'll talk about reasoning and latency in a sec, but let's dive into some pre-loaded ones here. So, it's the exact same prompt that I had put in and I have four different variants to look at. This is one of them. Fully interactive. It's actually pretty awesome. I do like this. >> Yeah. >> And even for context for people, like this is particularly cool for me because I literally just designed this play bar in Figma like 10 days ago. It just got shipped to production and now I'm seeing it. It's like it's not like a random play bar like I I pixel by pixel made this in Figma already. >> That's amazing because it's your source of truth, right? Like there is no reason to have to ever leave production anymore. You you can just work in that environment. So yeah, this is what it decided to come up with fully interactive. This one I liked personally. So like you have that all of this is interactive. I mean it's also like fully playing. So you can see that at 20 it's going to shift to the next. Yeah, there you go. So >> again, fully interactive. The reason it's interactive as it is is because it's code, right? Designing in code as a value prop that exists outside of DES. What we do is we make it accessible to you and through a visual interface and zero setup cost. >> I like this example because in the back of my head, I've known that I wanted a transcript feature that automatically responded to the play bar. Like I wanted to have it like follow along with the progress, but I had never explored it. And I it just, you know, it's not P 0, you know, like it's just not a thing that I'm going to be like, we have to build this kind of thing. But in just seeing this, I already now know, oh, like this is probably quite attainable, like borderline oneshotable, you know, like we should totally build this. So it like helped me even think about what the ROI of that feature is. >> Yeah. And this is like a big deal for us too. Like internally when we use test and we realized because it's becoming so easy to oneshot these things and they look like our product, our branding and I don't have to play with the branding piece of it. We're just doing way more prototypes now. Like we're literally everyday shipping random things that we wouldn't even want to try it right because the fiction is gone. You know, you are just able to explore a lot more things. >> There's a line that Cleo said on here like last year, maybe a couple years ago that I think about a lot. He talked about the aura of inevitability at Facebook in the early days and how it's like if something exists in code and it's already basically there. it's difficult to say no we shouldn't do this you know it's like it's like no it's like basically already there like make it happen you know and so when I look at this like as you know putting my stakeholder hat on I think that's why I'm personally so interested in designing in code because there is this aura of inevitability like somebody can play with it and it's real like the only decision is not do I want to commit resources to figure out if this is possible it's do you want this in the product yes or no check the box you know that's pretty powerful >> you're hitting a really I I think important piece is the trade-off that we used to have to make always like the design backlog of this pixel and this and this and that and like it's hard to quantify the impact of these things and and but these things in my opinion make up quality right it's this interaction of it moving over automatically hard to prioritize when you don't have the resources and that kind of thing but when it's tangible I think these things really compound into enabling you to build quality product and that trade of speed and quality that we used to have to make I think doesn't exist anymore because it's so achievable. Now it becomes what to build because you don't want to build too much. >> And then before we move on, do you how inflighty does this feel to you? >> This next tab here like go to the next tab. >> This one >> this is exactly inflight. And even for context, I have a transcript feature that is attached to a piece of video feedback. So like if a stakeholder gives you v video feedback, it leaves in our little feedback sidebar and it works great and I have a transcript and it's you can click on it. I don't have any of that functionality attached to like the main walkthrough that I as a designer would make. So if I'm making like a two-minute context digest of like this feature that I'm working on and I want to explain why I think it's a good idea or what feedback I'm looking for, there's no transcript associated with that. So what you did, I'm presuming I mean I know this is the case cuz it's identical. like you saw the context of the transcript that existed in a different piece of the codebase and you pulled from that UX and brought in those same styles and patterns and now they exist here which if I was designing this from scratch is exactly what I would have done. So, you know, for other people, they're looking at this and it looks like blue text and, you know, opacity differences, but to me, I see like a onetoone representation of what exists elsewhere in the codebase, which is it's cool. Like, I got a smile on my face. >> Amazing. >> I mean, code as a context is the one of the best contexts out there is code. There's so much decision making and so much information that's been in your codebase since the beginning of like, you know, you started the codebase and it's all still there, right? And I think it's all to be used and and alms and our AI is actually looking at those things and kind of converting those, you know, ideas that were just left in some random corner of code base and bring that into a visual uh screen for you. So you can actually see what that looks like. >> And there's like even like tribal knowledge, things that aren't really documented anywhere else. And this is why your codebase as a source of truth for Destin is really powerful. every other design tool these days, it feels like they're asking you to create your design system in there to then have to use it. And I think they actually make the problem worse. They further take away from production and they further fragment the tool chain. Our goal is to collapse everyone into one source of truth. The only that exists for your product and that's production. Um tool is is never I don't think can it can achieve this level of quality because they don't have the context that Destin has. And even if you're connecting components, it's it's not the same thing. Like codebase as a full context layer is different than like this piece or this piece, right? And that's just to your point about like what did it do? I often look at what it did because I'm curious. Let me explore more UI patterns. Yeah. So it's totally like the agent is going through and >> from different pieces. Now I understand the full uh structure. Let me look at this. It's a lot of like kind of what cursor does like at this point. >> I was just about to say that. Yeah, this looks like a clawed code chat, but I'm assuming like what about this? What about what's the startup here? Like I I'm assuming I'm not opening up a terminal and >> typing. Yeah, >> it's literally you log in. Yes, I have codebased access. You install us, a day later, you're going to have an environment ready for you like this. >> Wow. Okay. >> One click. We abstract away all the effort. >> And one thing we do is like each prototype is in its sandbox that we can infinitely copy paste and clone. You know, we'll talk at the end, you know, what that means. Like we've invested a lot in our infrastructure where it's very easy to take a prototype and infinitely clone it. So you can have AI work in a parallel way. And you know, like this thing that you see here, I can just clone it 10,000 times. That's a bit too much. You going to cost a lot of money, but times and have a different agent work on each one of those and you can really go deep in explorations, right? And you know one of the problems when you have cloud code you know imagine you're a designer you have to now learn git how to branch how to like there's work trees now which is a really cool primitive but good luck explaining work trees to a nontechnical person even I don't understand it you know like >> I was just trying to figure out work trees the other day and I I don't I still don't understand it actually >> I personally think it's a lot of primitive uh you know hot take and I think the light primitive [clears throat] is sandboxing your environment. I think like the light primitive is you know you should be able to sandbox and in a sandbox you can start up the sandbox instantly you don't have to set up the sandbox every time every time you download a codebase locally what do you have to do okay set up the docker thing set up the database set up this set up all that so one of the things that we did at Dustin is we built this compiler piece and it took us a long time to build that you can install Dustin on any codebase it could be a very very big codebase it could be a very complicated codebase it could be a simple codebase and we automat atically convert your codebase into a sandbox and into a prototyping environment. >> Yeah. I mean, even thinking back on my own journey as a designer who in and out throughout my career, I've tinkered in code. I can think of multiple instances where I'm like in a job, maybe I get a new computer, maybe something that I just still to this day have no idea what went wrong. All of a sudden, I just can't spin up my environment, you know? Like there's like 500 reasons for what that could be. I never actually know what they are. And it feels like a very significant social cost to like get the engineer to please can we just get on a zoo for an indefinite amount of time and you can help me get this working. That's always tough. And then I'm I'm also studying how these different teams are working and especially when you look at like bigger orgs like inflight seedstage startup. I have full freedom to do whatever the heck I want and I am friends with my engineer and he'll help me. But for these bigger companies, you need this like topdown investment to even get designers to the point where they do have like their own fork of a code base or something like that cuz they're not going to be able to do that on their own. And so like that's what I have felt the need for for the last few, you know, months up to like a year even where it's like, man, I I just want to be able to point at part of prod and just explore and make changes. And I feel like I have to do so much of that work myself. I'm curious like how much that even fits into your vision. You were talking about this sandboxing thing, Nim. Like what do you where do you see this going in terms of what these core types of use cases even are? >> Design is essentially explorations, right? What we're trying to do with this technology is we want to build an interface where it feels like you're discovering your product in the latent space and not necessarily building it and pixel pushing. Right? We believe that every permutation of your product that ever exists exists somewhere in some hypothetical latent space. Right? There's a world where your product looks very differently because in this one design review it went completely, you know, someone else won the design argument and now your product works differently. Well, that exists and you should be able to see what that looks like even though you didn't get to work on that. So you know right now the UI we have is this kind of very lovably user UI and the reason for that is because we spent so much of innovation tokens on the compiler piece that we didn't have time to innovate on the UX but we fully believe that the future of design is exploration. We're going to launch in the next quarter an infinite canvas where the sandboxing you can create infinite sandboxes and infinite parallel agents that could then explode things for you. And we really want Destin to feel like you're exploring your product and not necessarily pixel pushing. >> This little example that you have up here right here is like it's kind of a fun example of what you're talking about because it's like not that important of a part of the product. Like it's just not, you know, I've had it on my mental to-do list of like there's probably a better way to do that. It's not P 0. It's not anywhere close to P 0. So, I've invested zero time and I don't really have a desire to like push a bunch of pixels around and like really get into the weeds of that because there's way more things that I'm focusing on that are more important. But if I could point an agent at it and be like, \"Hey, can you just show me 20 other ways of how this could look?\" And then I could be like, \"Oh, that those two are interesting. Can you show me eight more in that bucket?\" I bet I would pick one and ship it because I know there's something better. >> Your role is going to become curation and selection. And that's where taste comes in. >> Let me push on that a little bit. Let me push on that a little bit because I'm sure there's somebody listening that's like, I like making the thing. I like getting my hands dirty, keeping my hands in the clay. I don't want to just be in charge of an art gallery and and purely a curator, right? And so there's this spectrum that I always like to kind of double click on when talking to people who are imagining the future of design tooling, which is on one hand it's pure prompting, managing a fleet of agents with natural language, you know, and then on the other there's some direct manipulation and really specifically moving that thing or changing that thing. And I'm curious at like a philosophical level, where do you see this going? you're in a position where you have to kind of bet on the future a little bit. How do you think about it? >> My take is that we have to go this way and then we can build the other piece, but we have to get to this part first because I think LLM's fundamentally move you up the leverage stack and moving pixels around sometimes is not the highest leverage thing you should be doing. in the example that you've just shared. I think there's a lot of value, a ton to be extracted in the curation piece and then there can be a pro user or like you know pro kind of level where you can be able to dig in but maybe you want to dig in after you've selected one right like there is still value in the curation process and not just starting from scratch. My take is I feel like these kind of spectrum arguments a lot of the times is happening because we're going through a platform shift and we have this mental model of a world and we think these things are mutually exclusive. I don't think they necessarily are. You know you changing a pixel right versus an AI doing let's you ask the AI to do it. They're pretty much the same thing. Maybe the future is you can still feel that feeling you feel but in a way more efficient way and way less pixel pushy. Right? So imagine I have this thing in front of me. I can then be like, hey, I want to push this pixels, you know, I want to change the padding here with this button and these are the constraints I want and I want to explode that. I did the same thing. I still push that pixel. It's just that I can now see more option at the same time, right? I don't think it's like taking your mouse and pushing that makes you that feeling. It's like, you know, having a thought in your head and seeing that thought come to fruition is what makes you have that feeling, right? So, I think the future is gonna be a UX that maybe doesn't exist today that's going to make you feel both. It's going to make you feel like you can have this infinite exploration that AI is doing, but you also have a lot of control and agency over what gets shipped. I think both are going to be true. It just may not look like a Figma like UI where you're manually changing colors, right? It may just look very differently. And I just feel like we haven't invented that UX yet. And this is why it's such a difficult conversation to have. >> It feels like most people are asking for a faster force. are asking us for pixel movement and that kind of thing which I get because it's familiar and we haven't actually invented the car yet. So we are in this like kind of middle weird round where you're stuck a little and you still want that familiarity because the better solution hasn't been invented but we are straight line towards that better solution regardless of what feels familiar >> and we are a lot we have a lot of opinions on that we wear those opinions on sleeves and we do say no to a lot of features and I think like in a platform shift like you have to do that if you want to innovate it is really hard to do because you are building a company you have users and you see their pain and you're like okay maybe I have to build something for you today even though I think more best about how you're going to work. So, we have that balance, but we do have a lot of opinions on what future looks like and and yeah, we just think we have to get there and we'll see how that change. To use another horse metaphor, people still ride horses today, right? Uh they don't use horses to go from point A to point B. It's fun to ride horses. People still they drive a car cuz it's more efficient A to B, right? I think people are going to do the thing that's more efficient. But I do understand like you know like sometimes what I do like when I'm in an airplane there's no Wi-Fi and literally light code with hands and I feel like such a caveman I can do that too right I'm just not going to ship some you know it's going to slow me down in my work environment so I'm not going to do it there but on the weekends I'm lighting hand you know I'm lighting code with my hands and it's a lot of fun and I don't think that's going to go away. We're going to have postpack lighting and whatever that looks like for design is still going to be there. Think I've been designing products every day for the last 15 years. But in [music] the last 6 months, everything has changed. With AI in the mix, I'm cranking out ideas faster than ever. But none of that matters if I can't get the feedback that I need to get the team aligned. And right now, getting async feedback still kind of sucks. So, [music] I'm building the product I've always wanted, and it's called Inflight. I use it every day to share ideas and get feedback from the team. and it's totally changing the way that I work. So, I'm [music] excited to show you. Right now, I'm only giving access to diveclub listeners. So, head to dive.comclub/inflight to claim your spot. I [music] am able to make the connection to my current workflow, which is like, you know, especially if I'm doing things that are slightly more green field, I'm often looking for inspiration. Like I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm on mobin pretty frequently or I have like a really organized notion inspiration database that I'll like you know say like I want to look at modals and I'll just look at 20 modals and you know something something will happen where I'll have some idea sparked and now kind of listening to you talk I'm starting to wonder huh is that part of the process maybe going to look more like having the models create 20 things for me to look at that all are derivatives of like what exists, what's already in the system. They look and feel. So like right now, the the set of inspiration that I'm using to kind of spark my next idea is really all over the place and doesn't look and feel like anything that is relevant to my product. But having the models create these like launching pads for me. >> Yeah. >> Where I might not even think about getting my hands dirty until I see 20 things which spark that next idea that I'm like I'm kind of nodding my head a little bit. I'm like, I could see myself working like that frequently. Like that would kind of become my default. >> We're actually pretty close. And I think it is a powerful workflow. >> Yeah, I want the canvas for sure. >> Yeah, that's coming. It's coming. And that's the thing actually recently, you know, the debate kind of has been canvas versus code >> which >> doesn't make sense because one is a space and one is a medium like they they are not mutually exclusive. I actually can show you a canvas anchored in code right now. Love that because this is defin this is what I want. I totally agree that the debate on Twitter project that is coming soon is not >> yes >> it's very very in beta but you can yeah imagine an agent working here and you go here like you you break apart one component here explore it over here then put it back >> code and c like they're not the same thing so they are not a a versus thing like they're not mutually exclusive at all. Um, this [clears throat] is a canvas anchored in code. Not everything you do has to be code. You can pull in an asset and do something there and then bring it into what you actually want to ship. It feels too binary right now. The the debate feels too binary. The canvas versus code one. >> It does feel like given the current state of tools though I have to make a choice. >> Yes. >> And I I have to be very strategic about what that choice is. Like for every single thing that I'm working on, there's this moment where I'm like, am I going to go into Figma and make a mess, or am I going to open up a terminal and do the whole dev route or am I maybe just going to like make something that's like completely isolated and I don't really care about my design system in like a lovable or be zero or something like that. That choice of which direction I go feels way more important than it should be, you know, like I'm really putting myself down a funnel. >> It is current state of tooling versus future. Hopefully you can see that the direction that we're going to while we have conviction is the right one. But I totally get the current state and and and we're not there. >> Everything I said I think we will look back on as this blip on the historical radar of software development. Like it just feels like we are kind of in this weird transition time >> and you kind of got to brute force some of the new stuff sometimes, but it's not always going to be like that. >> I think tools define how you create, how you work, and what you create. I think it's usually a tooling problem. A lot of things can be solved by the right tools. I think prelims we couldn't build the right ones and and now we can. >> Maybe we can just pull on that and zoom out from the impact of tools a little bit. You talked briefly about how these tools kind of move people up the leverage value chain. But can we go deeper there for a second? Like you were thinking so deeply about where this is headed and how it's going to change software creation, how it's going to change the role of the designer. What do you see in terms of how this might even shift the value propositions of what a designer brings to the table? How to succeed in this role? Like if somebody's watching, they're looking at this and they're like, \"Wa, this is really compelling, but it's very different than how I have made a living for the last eight years and it's a little bit murky thinking about the next eight years of how I want to keep being a professional UX designer. What do these tools mean for me?\" I'm curious what you'd say to that person. >> There are a few things I think. One is we have designers spending 4 to eight hours a day in Des. So it's it's something that can definitely fit into your existing skill set. When we move towards curation, I think that's the thing. Your skills are going to fundamentally change. It doesn't take away from the outcome that you're driving for your product, right? And and that's I think one thing to focus on is what's been the outcome that we're all working towards. >> This is so normal because the anxiety is so high. like I'm not learning 28 parallel agents in cloud code. Am I going to get left behind because I'm not doing that? And I think we >> what's the outcome? I talked about parallel code agent side but I sometimes get a bit annoyed at like people saying okay other than 28 parallel code agents look at that. It's like but what's the outcome of that? Are you trying to ship 28 PRs? Is that 28 features that are just random features? Are you trying to explore something and then choosing one of them? Right? And I feel like no one actually talks about the outcome that we want. And sometimes we get because of the anxiety is bogged down with the medium and the tools that we're using. But I think we need to think about like what's the value of AI and how can it make us do a better job and and you know make us have better outcomes and how can we use it in our current dayto-day >> and that outcome for us is actually helping companies build the right product right um it's not like speed and efficiency and all of that are around it but building the right product means also putting it in the hands of people who've never had access to it before the designers npms having access to this environment has quality impact on a more macro level it means you can build the right thing faster. One of the thesis that we started uh Dustin with and this is what we funded on was the code is going to be commoditized like AI has writing and the thing is right now if you know what feature to ship and you know exactly how it fits well you can just tell cloud code it will just do it for you and I think that part is not that difficult anymore like it's pretty much done I think what's difficult is what is that what should we ship and this is where the idea of parallel agents and I said look at the outcome I like parallel agents because of exploration. You know, I don't like paddle agents because I'm shipping something to FL right away. I'm just exploding a lot and then I can choose what I like. I can align with people and maybe we can even do user testing with his prototypes. And once I know what to ship, well then I'm shipping only that piece of code. I'm not shipping all the code to plug. And I think prototyping is going to be more and more important in the future because of this phenomenon. And this is where you know people say that code review is the bottleneck. I disagree with that simply because your 25 parallel clock codes should not all have a PR, right? Like maybe like you explore a lot and one of them has a PR. So I think in the world that we're envisioning, you're prototyping so much more. A lot of that is going to be throwaway code, right? And maybe like users will still see that code. Maybe there's some feature flags that you still push it to your users, but at the end of the day, once you figure out what that thing that you should push, then it's just one PR and then you ship that. And in that world you can imagine designers they are the taste makers they are the ones who understand branding who understand color and who understand all these things. In that world we think designers is the next generation of software builders right because once you figure out what to do AI will just do that for you. >> I'm definitely interpreting this as the value of certain soft skills feel like they're about to exponentially increase. I'm even thinking of a post on Reddit that I saw today that was basically somebody kind of complaining a little bit about is my job really having to talk to all of these people like [laughter] feel figure out what they actually like think and want and say like I just want to go execute and like in my head I'm like oh boy this is going to be tough for you moving forward because like you said n it's if you know exactly what to build my gosh you can oneshot it like you can oneshot it it's not hard to oneshot a medium-sized feature if you know exactly what to build and are good at communicating all of the challenges and opportunities for designers is going to be navigating everything before that because that starting point for exploration I think is going to be more and more ambiguous like as you can scale exploration you don't need to be pointed at a problem as a designer figure out the best way to solve that problem generally hey there's this like rough opportunity space in this whole area of the product what do you think we should do over there you can almost zoom out given the fact that you can explore 10x more so much more quickly which I think is probably tying back to what you were saying earlier Gab about design being elevated up the strategic value chain like whether you like it or not like that's where impact is shifting as a designer and obviously I think there are pros and cons depending on who you are and what you want to get out of the role but man I'm so excited is there a more important role than design in a company in this this coming era I don't know I I I think there's a more important role than design in the world. Like UX to me is everything. It's it's it's it's everything. >> I find a lot of this very compelling. And you know, you you teased some of the stuff that's coming next with like canvas. You talked about kind of the like v1 of variance. It's obvious that you have a lot of things in progress right now. So just kind of paint the picture like where are you at right now? What are some of these next milestones that you're pushing towards? When we release this episode, we are going from private beta to public beta. You will be able to go through the onboarding flow which allows you to connect your codebase and you will get your environment a day later. If you have any questions at all, email me. >> I mean, I'm I'm excited just seeing the little inflight software connected badge up at the top. Like that alone gets me kind of jazzed. So, I'm looking forward to continue to play with it. And Gab Nim, thank you for coming on and showing us what you've been cooking up. It's exciting and I think it paints a very compelling picture about where this is all headed. So, thanks for coming on. [music] Before I let you go, I want to take just one minute to run you through my favorite products because I'm constantly asked [music] what's in my stack. Framer is how I build websites. Genway is how I do research. Granola is how I take notes during crit. [music] Jitter is how I animate my designs. Lovable is how I build my ideas in code. Mobin is how I find design inspiration. Paper is how I design like a creative. And Raycast is my shortcut every step of the way. Now, I've hand selected these companies so that I can do these episodes full-time. So, by far the number one way to support the show is to check them out. You can find the full list at dive.club/partners.",
