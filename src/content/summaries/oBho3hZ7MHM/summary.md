## Key Takeaways

Product leader and author Teresa Torres shares her Claude Code workflow for non-technical productivity, showing how AI can become a 'pair programming' partner for everything from task management to research.

*   **Build Your Own Task Manager:** Instead of using rigid third-party tools, Torres built a custom, AI-native task system in Obsidian using Markdown files tagged by Claude, enabling natural language task creation, intelligent search, and daily digests via a `/today` slash command.

*   **Automate Research Digests:** She created a Python plugin that runs daily searches on ar

Xiv and Google Scholar for her topics, presents a filtered digest, and then automatically generates detailed summaries (focusing on methods and effect sizes) of any papers she downloads the next day.

*   **Create a Modular Context Library:** The key to 'lazy prompting' is not one giant context file, but a structured, indexed library of small, focused files (e.g., writing style guide, business profile). Claude uses an index to dynamically pull only the relevant context for a given task, dramatically improving output quality.

*   **Augment, Don't Automate (Writing):** Torres uses Claude primarily as a writing *critic* and research assistant, not a ghostwriter. By providing a detailed, co-created style guide, Claude gives targeted feedback, fact-checks claims, and fixes typos, allowing her to retain her authentic voice.

*   **The 'Pair Everything' Mindset:** The core philosophy is applying the engineer's concept of pair programming to all tasks. Claude becomes a 'pair AI buddy' that can suggest automations, manage context, and proactively help based on seeing your tasks and notes.

*   **Embrace Iterative Co-Creation:** Her systems weren't built in one go. She constantly asks Claude, "What did we learn today that should go in a context file?" letting the AI help document and refine its own instructions and the system's taxonomy.

## Summary

### Introduction and Core Philosophy

Teresa Torres, author of *Continuous Discovery Habits*, explains her evolution to using Claude Code as her primary AI tool. Initially drawn to Claude for writing, she adopted Claude Code within VS Code to level up her engineering practices. This introduced her to the concept of 'pair programming' with an AI, which she has expanded into a 'pair everything' mindset. She now uses Claude as a collaborative partner for task management, writing, research, and more, fundamentally changing how she works by having an AI that can see her tasks and context and proactively assist.

### Custom AI-Native Task Management

Frustrated with locked-in, non-searchable data in tools like Trello, Torres built her own task management system. The core components are:

*   **Markdown Files in Obsidian:** All tasks, ideas, and bugs are simple Markdown files with YAML front matter (for due dates and tags) stored in an Obsidian vault, making everything text-based and accessible to Claude.

*   **The `/today` Slash Command:** Every morning, she runs this custom command. It searches her task folder for items due or overdue, checks a (now unused) Trello board via MCP, and generates a fresh 'Today' digest file in Obsidian.

*   **Natural Language Task Creation:** Because Claude Code is always open, she can instantly create tasks by typing, e.g., "new task: Send thank you to Claire," and Claude formats it, sets a due date, suggests tags, and updates her list. The speed and lack of GUI friction are key benefits.

*   **Intelligent Search and Tagging:** Unlike traditional tools, she can ask Claude vague questions about her notes and tasks. Claude excels at finding context even with imperfect recall, and it handles all the tagging automatically, co-creating a managed taxonomy with her.

### Automating Academic Research

To stay current on academic papers without daily discipline, Torres built an automated research pipeline:

*   **Daily Searches:** A Python script runs via cron job, searching ar

Xiv (daily) and Google Scholar (weekly) for pre-defined keywords related to her interests (e.g., synthetic users, team collaboration).

*   **Curated Digest:** The results populate a 'research digest' on her daily to-do list. She spends 5-10 minutes scanning and manually downloading relevant PDFs into topic-specific 'source' folders.

*   **Automated Summaries:** A second nightly script finds new PDFs, triggers Claude Code agents to summarize them, and adds the summaries to a 'research today' file. The summaries are critically focused, analyzing methods and effect sizes to help her evaluate the paper's validity—a workflow that recently allowed her to publish a timely, critical analysis of a new study on Linked

In.

### Building Context Libraries for Lazy Prompting

Torres realized that giving Claude high-quality, relevant context is essential, but a single massive context file is counterproductive. Her solution is a structured, modular library:

*   **Small, Focused Files:** She maintains an Obsidian vault dedicated to 'LM Context' with dozens of small files: a detailed writing style guide (co-created by having Claude analyze her blog), a business profile, product details, audience definitions, etc.

*   **The Index Strategy:** A key file (like 'business profile.md') acts as an index, telling Claude what context is available (e.g., 'company overview,' 'course details'). Her global `.claude.md` instructs Claude to use the relevant profile based on the query's topic (business vs. personal).

*   **Dynamic Context Loading:** For any given task, Claude reads the index and dynamically pulls in only the few, relevant small context files. This prevents context overload and ensures precise, tailored assistance. She builds this library iteratively by asking Claude at the end of sessions, "What did you learn today that we should document?"

### The Writing Workflow: AI as Critic, Not Author

Torres loves writing and prefers augmentation over automation. Her workflow involves:

*   **Claude as a Real-Time Editor:** She writes in Obsidian with Claude Code open in a terminal alongside. She asks for feedback on hooks, section strength, and fact-checking.

*   **Style-Guide Driven Feedback:** Because of her detailed context file, Claude's critiques are specific to her goals, audience, and preferred style—not generic advice.

*   **Targeted Automation:** She has allowed Claude to do the bulk of writing only twice: once for transforming interview transcripts into stories and once for synthesizing podcast themes, with her providing heavy oversight, intros, and conclusions.

### Conclusion and Practical Advice

Torres's setup demonstrates the power of using Claude Code as a deeply integrated, context-aware partner. Her final tips include using `/clear` liberally when Claude gets stuck and relying on her context library to restart conversations cleanly without re-explaining everything. She advocates for building your own systems to match your idiosyncratic workflows, starting with a custom to-do list as a perfect first project. The ultimate goal is to move from thinking 'How can I use AI for this task?' to having an AI partner that can look at your to-do list and ask, 'What can I just do for you today?'
