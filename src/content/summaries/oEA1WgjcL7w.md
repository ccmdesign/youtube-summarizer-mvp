  Claude Code **Skills** allow developers to extend the AI's capabilities through specialized directories containing a `skill.md` file. 
  - **Progressive Disclosure** keeps context windows small by only loading deeper documentation or scripts when needed.
  - Skills enable **reproducible workflows** by linking AI instructions to local scripts (Node, Python) and can be shared via global marketplaces.

## Key Takeaways

Claude Skills transform a general-purpose LLM into a specialized agent capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks with high precision.

*   **Progressive Disclosure:** By keeping the entry `skill.md` file concise, users can prevent context window bloat, as the model only accesses supplementary files and scripts if the task requires them.

*   **Language Agnostic Tooling:** Skills can wrap any runtime, allowing Claude to execute **Node.js**, **Python**, or shell scripts to handle tasks that are prone to LLM hallucinations, such as complex CLI flags.

*   **Portability and Marketplaces:** Skills can be installed per-project or globally, and they are designed to be shared through centralized repositories or marketplaces, similar to plugins.

## Summary

The video introduces **Claude Skills**, a feature within the **Claude Code** CLI environment that allows for the creation of modular, teachable units of functionality. At its core, a skill is simply a directory containing a `skill.md` file that describes what the skill does and when the LLM should invoke it. This structure allows developers to move beyond simple chat interactions toward building a library of automated, high-precision tools.

### The Power of Progressive Disclosure
One of the most significant architectural features discussed is **Progressive Disclosure**. Instead of overwhelming the LLM with a massive prompt containing every possible instruction, the `skill.md` file acts as a slim 'table of contents.' When the model identifies a task that matches the skill's description, it follows links within the markdown file to discover more detailed documentation, data, or specific scripts. This method is highly efficient for managing the **context window**, ensuring that the model stays focused and operates at a lower cost.

### Building a Custom Skill
The author demonstrates building an **FFmpeg video scaling skill**. While LLMs are generally aware of FFmpeg, they often struggle with specific syntax or complex command-line arguments. By creating a skill, the developer provides a deterministic Node.js script that uses `child_process` to invoke FFmpeg reliably. 

The workflow involves:

- Creating a `.claude/skills` directory.

- Writing a `skill.md` that points to a specific **scripts folder**.

- Implementing a small Node.js script to handle the actual file transformation.

- Using the `/skills` command in Claude Code to verify and trigger the automation.

### Deployment and Extensibility
Beyond local project use, skills are designed for scale. They can be installed globally on a machine or bundled into a **marketplace** repository. This allows teams to share standardized workflows—such as database migrations, deployment scripts, or media processing—across different projects. By treating these skills as code, developers can version control their AI's capabilities, leading to more stable and predictable agentic behavior.

## Context

As the industry shifts from simple AI chat interfaces to 'Agentic Coding,' the need for deterministic tools grows. Claude Skills represent a middle ground between manual coding and fully autonomous agents. This matters because it addresses the 'hallucination' problem by giving the AI specific scripts to run rather than asking it to guess commands. For developers, this connects to the broader trend of 'LLM-Ops' and tool-use (Function Calling), where the goal is to provide AI models with a sandbox of reliable tools to solve real-world engineering problems efficiently.
