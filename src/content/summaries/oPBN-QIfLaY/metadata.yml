title: "Vibe Check: Claude Cowork Is Claude Code for the Rest of Us"
description: >-
  Anthropic just dropped Claude Cowork—essentially Claude Code for everyone, not
  just engineers—and we got to chat about it with a product engineer at
  Anthropic who helped build it.


  In this live Vibe Check, Dan Shipper and Kieran Klaassen explore the new
  interface together, testing what works (and what doesn't) in real time.
  Anthropic’s Felix Rieseberg joins midway through to explain the philosophy
  behind Cowork's design: why it separates "Tasks" from "Chats," how the queue
  system lets you send messages while the agent is working, and what
  "agent-native" architecture means in practice. They also dig into
  Skills—Claude's prompt system that lets you customize how it works—and the
  Chrome connector for browser automation.


  This is a raw, unfiltered first look at what might be the future of how
  knowledge workers interact with AI: async workflows instead of turn-by-turn
  chat.
