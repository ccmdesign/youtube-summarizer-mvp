  "fullText": "If you're a non-technical person, you are used to a world where you send a prompt and then you get a response within a couple minutes. And once you send a prompt or a chat, you can't do anything else with that AI. This is built for working with your AIS in an async way. This new cloud co-work app is a really good example of agent native architectures, which means at the bottom of the app, instead of having like software that works by deterministic rules, you have an agent and the agent is wired up to the UI of the app. I've been at Anthropic for a little bit, but uh this is the product that my team has built here. We've sprinted at this for the last week and a half. Um what we're trying >> the last week and a half. >> That's it. Come on. >> We've got a new anthropic drop. So Anthropic just dropped Claude Co-work, which is basically Cloud Code for non-technical people. We got access to it early at every and so I'm going to give you a a quick run through of what it is and how it works. We'll have a full writeup on every uh in a in a few hours probably. We're just we're kind of figuring out um how to do these things. So um and I'm going to add Kieran. Kieran is here. Hello Kieran. How you doing? >> Hey, what's up? So, uh, I was just telling everybody if you're if you just got here, we are about to do a vibe check of Anthropics new, uh, Claude co-work feature, uh, which is it's basically Claude Code, but for non-technical folks. Um, I'm going to just demo it for you right now in here. And okay, so let me just share my screen. All right, so this is what it looks like. It's cloud co-work. So you'll see we've got um the chat on over here to the left. So, you still got regular chat, you've got code here, and then we've got co-work. So, it's it's three the three C's. Um, it starts with let's knock something off your list. I love the copyrightiting here. Um, you can tell from way they did this that um the it's it's really designed to do uh deeper tasks on your computer than maybe chat is. So, you know, create a file or crunch data or make a prototype, send a message, um organize files. Uh, it's got over here, uh, progress. It's got artifacts, uh, context. We've been we've been playing around with this for a couple hours now. I think it's cool. I think it's cool. I think there's there's a lot of like really interesting questions from the UX perspective of chat versus code versus work. And I think you can you can really think of cowork as being it's like chat that has access to your computer and runs for a long time. Um, which is essentially cloud code, but just less intimidating. So, a couple things that we did that I think are kind of interesting to look at. Okay, so here's an example of it working. I asked it to go to the every.TO website um and find five competitive companies that do the kind of consulting that we do and then analyze our positioning and you'll see it like just went and used my computer. It's it's running in a in a long loop. So, this is this is a really interesting one where you can do this with regular Claude. like Claude can do this but the number of iterations that it's going through this is many many many minutes of iterations so it looks a lot more like um actually can make this markdown so it looks a lot more like cloud code but it's friendly enough for anyone to anyone to use um well we'll look at the another thing I had to do I have a uh I have an I have a dinner that I have to go to tomorrow night that I had to I to prepare some remarks for and uh I asked it to basically like go go to my Gmail and prepare remarks. It has a it has a connector to Gmail and to Google calendar but the connector wasn't working I think because this is like very beta and was not out when I was testing this. Um and let's see and I asked it to draft a response and it drafted a response and I think the response is actually pretty good. So um this actually sounds like me. This is kind of crazy. Kieran, you got to look at this because this is has some implications for Kora. Um, so basically the setup was I have a dinner tomorrow that I have to do remarks for and I asked it and the person who organized the dinner was asking me um can you tell me like what you're going to what you want to talk about and uh so I just said like read find the email and draft a response based on what you think I would say. And this is something that I could I think I actually could send with minimal edits, which is it's pretty cool. Are you seeing this, Kieran? >> Yes. Looks good. >> I think one of the the things that's good about this is um it it's gone through many many steps to both identify what I would say and how I would say it and has all the context which is like Yeah, it's pretty cool. >> Yeah. I Yeah, go for it. >> Yeah. So, how is coowork different than chat? like co-work is more made to uh you can you can share your screen but like it's more made to like go longer like really work on something. So it's more focused on on getting you some work done and this is what we know in cloth code already like when you trigger ultra think or your trigger planning mode things like that. So it it is similar in certain ways but it also it will unlock a lot of things that you use as a developer in cloth codes that now suddenly work very well for non-developer tasks. Yeah, I can sort of see this being a thing that um just really accelerates, you know, our growth team or um you know, our our people who are in our consulting business who want to do some of these tasks and maybe are using cloud code, but maybe it's like a little bit less intuitive. Um it should be released now. I think that they're they're maybe holding it back, but the blog post is live. So, you can take a look at the blog post. It's uh co-work research preview. I'll throw it in the in the chat. Um, and yeah. Uh, so I think it'll be it'll be out soon. Let me I'll I'll like I can check with my anthropic people. Um, but uh okay, let me go back to this. So I also asked it to do a calendar audit. This looks like it's actually still running on this, which is crazy. I asked this like an hour ago. Go through the past month of my calendar and do an audit. Tell me how this reflects my priorities and whether it's aligned with my goals. Um, just browse on Chrome. >> Can you share your screen again, please? >> Oh, shoot. Yeah, >> thanks. >> Um, >> yeah. >> Uh, tell me how go through the past month of my calendar and do an audit. Tell me how this relates to my goals. Um, and it just, you know, it's been browsing on my computer for like hours and hours. One thing that's or not hours and hours, but like for about an hour. One thing that's different about this which I think is really interesting is um in Claude when you start a chat and it's responding you have to stop it in order to send a new message. But this uh just output I can just add to the queue. So this is a little bit more like the um uh this is more like the cloud code experience. So, I think this is this is one of those situations where um it's built for you to send stuff as it's working and it's not like a back like one message, one response, one message, one response. So, it's it's really more built for long long tasks. >> Yeah. And it has the to-do uh task uh also built in on the right, which is nice. So, you can see where it is and what it's doing. >> Yeah, exactly. Um, another thing I did is I fed it a a book and I this is a book that I it's called The Outsider that I've been reading for a book that I'm writing and um I just asked it to like basically read the book, read the entire book and construct a taxonomy of all the main characters and ideas. And looks like it did this. And this is something that you could also do with um with the uh uh uh with regular cloud, but it would be it would just be less detailed. This is really interesting. I wonder. >> So yeah, so if you want to trigger those longer running tasks, uh like you can just say make a plan do this. So I assume if you just push it to do that more, it will just run for longer. So if you say take an hour to read through every single email, it won't give up as easily as before and it will just keep going. So please >> try those things. >> Yeah, it has a it has a uh it it does have a plan mode. It said I have not used the plan mode yet, but that's pretty cool. I also asked it to go through our post hog analytics and do some data gathering. So we published this guide. If you haven't seen this guide, it's like I keep talking about this. Everyone in every is like making fun of me because I I can't stop talking about a agent native architectures. We published this guide last week and we have these um we have these uh buttons read with cloud read with chap and I was curious okay how many people click these buttons and that's the kind of thing where I would go ask Andre who runs our platform and be like can you go look this up but instead I just said can you go into post I just went to co-work and I said can you go into post hog and just find all this stuff and it said okay total chat with claude button cooks 4,000. That's actually freaking crazy. Oh my god. >> We should get money. We should referral >> referral fees, baby. Uh what about uh chat with chat GBT? What about um uh copy for agent? And >> so this is cool because we we were in a rush since we started this morning and we didn't have any MCP set up. What we just did was we connected Chrome and Dan is logged in on Chrome in post hog. So just browse to the thing did got the things. So that's that's very handy like MVP just make sure you connect Chrome. That's a very good one to add already. You can al also do that with the normal but it it's very good at browsing and figuring things out especially now it doesn't stop as quickly which is really really handy. So anything you can do in a browser you can now use co-work for to like use longer running task and kick off things and you can use multiple uh tabs as well. So you can have five tabs uh being controlled by cloud and running which is great. >> Totally. Totally. And it sounds like uh it's this is down for people. So come come hang out. >> It's done for me. Yeah, it's done for me as well. But but for Dan is working. So >> I'm the only one it's open for. So we've got a monopoly here on on anthropic co-work content. So if you're here and you have stuff you want me to try, >> uh just let me know. I'm happy to happy to throw it in the chat. And um and make sure wait I I have I have something fun to do. Make sure that um you use every you read every because every is the only subscription that you need to stay at the edge of AI. Every.TO. We've got these vibe checks when new models come out. We get them beforehand. We had this several hours ago. We knew it was coming um since last week. Um and we always have all the up totheminute stuff that you might need. We also have um a bundle of apps that we make. We have an app like the one that Kieran makes called Kora, which is an assistant, an email assistant. We've got one called Sparkle that helps you organize your files. We've got Spiral, which helps you write. And we've also got Monologue, which is a speechtoext app, which I will show you shortly. And let's actually go back to um uh let's actually go back to the uh Claude uh demo real quick. So, and Karen, if you see anyone asking questions, just >> Yeah. Yeah. There's one good question from Hunter. He says, \"How good is it at research?\" Like one one of the things I love cla normal for is the deep research. Like does that exist? So maybe we can see if if it can do deep research on something. >> Yeah, let me know. >> Let me know if you have a research query you want me to try. But like I can show you, you know, uh actually, you know what? I'm going to share a different screen. Hold on. Um plus share screen. Okay. I'm figuring out my live stream setup. This is the first time that we've really done a uh live stream for a vibe check. Okay. So, um now you should be able to see my screen again. So, for research like okay, it depends on what you mean by research, right? Because this is a research query. Can you connect to Post Hog and tell me for the agent native guide that we published last week how many people clicked the chat? Like that is research and it does give me actually like a really good um answer which this is so interesting. Okay. Um but like another form of research that we talked about is okay analyze my competitors. Um this is specifically analyze our competitors for um the every consulting business. And I'm going to say open and proof. Proof is the agent native markdown editor that I built over the weekend. Can you believe I just said that? Um, and so this is a this is a research document that um uh Claude Co put together. Um, which uh, you know, it's not like it's not the meatiest thing I've ever seen. Let's see. I think this is not bad. Um, I'm not noticing like a super significant difference between this and like what a normal quad would would pull out, but I can see the research itself is more um is much more extensive than normal quad would do. And let me just actually throw this into normal. You can see also so if you do deep research the the research agent in chat that's pretty extensive normally but here you can see more. >> Um so yeah I I don't know maybe that is also available in in that version. We're still figuring out what everything is that is available but it's very close to what you can do in cloth code. So a kind of a fusion of chat and cloth codes is is co-work. Yeah. Yeah. This is very like you can see that they're calling these tasks as opposed to chats. So, it's it's supposed to be I think here's here's a good way to think about it. A good way to think about it is if you're a non-technical person, you are used to a world where you send a prompt and then you get a response within a couple minutes. And once you send a a prompt or a chat, you can't do anything else with that AI. You have to like move on to something else. This is built for working with your AIS in an async way. So, um, everything is set up like the the idea of a task, the idea of having a queue. This is all set up so that you can say say go do something and then not think about it for a while and then come back, which is very different from claude where the normal cloud app you're you're kind of you're you're trying to you're trying to get an answer pretty quick. And I think that's the best mental shift. I think the real question that I have is, is this deserving of its own tab? for one one reason it might be is there's a difference between like how you might treat one of these versus one of these. Like these are more throwaway. These are probably like bigger chunks of work. But honestly, it's like kind of confusing. I would rather just um I think that they I would rather just have it all in one tab and then have it do different levels of research and thinking and and um async based on the task and maybe based on um you know a setting like saying like really [ __ ] think about this. I don't know. What do you think Erin? How would you solve this? >> Yeah. Yeah. Like for me it's also confusing. It's like oh great there's another tab and I have to like first think where to go. I do get it because >> I I've seen this transition as engineers as an engineer like we we had the like copy paste into chat GPT obviously and then like uh that evolved into cursor like more agentic which evolved to like I don't look at code anymore and and I think there will be a similar transition for people that do research or co-work like maybe now people are used to go into Chrome and like seeing what's going on, what's happening. Um to towards more of like I'm just going to let it rip and do its thing. And then after it gets back, I'm going to review whatever the output is rather than understanding every single step all the way. And and then you're like clearly already there. That's how you're thinking. But I do understand if you're not there, if you're more like in the chat thing where it's like, \"Oh, do this now. Why don't you look at this?\" Like if you have that conversation, it's maybe more chat and co-work is more you hand off a task to your agent and your agent comes back and you review the work and you can follow up but you can give extra directions. But I do understand to introduce a new tab because there you need to shift your mind to do that and obviously we're doing that. But I understand lots of people in the world, especially that are not coders, still have to make that transition where you just hand off something and then let it do stuff for 30 minutes or an hour and then come back and review that. So I do understand why they want to separate it even though it's all the same technology because chat code and co-work similar uh like harnessing around it. it is philosophically or how you use it maybe a little bit different. So I guess that's why they did that. >> Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting too because we, you know, when we did this um when we did this original vibe check when we got it a couple hours ago, we had we had me and Kieran and a couple other people on the phone from internally at every and we were demoing it together and their initial reaction was like I don't know how this is different and is this like even that that useful compared to regular cloud or cloud code because a lot of them are just using cloud code directly and I think that that's like that was a really interesting thing for me where you're not going to realize how useful this is until you get your hands on it. And there's probably going to be a learning curve on on it where if you're a non-technical user who is used to who's not used to the idea that you can just like hand off your work and then come back, it's probably going to take a while to to like actually figure that out and and get used to this as a UX paradigm. So maybe there's some benefit then to like having it be a separate tab so people can like basically realize, oh yeah, this is this is different and I should treat this differently. It's a real adjustment. Um >> yeah yeah >> yeah and that's >> so if you want to learn about that adjustment like we're writing about that for coding but you could really apply whatever is happening to coding probably for co-work as well like how how that shift happens how how that goes how that goes uh so yeah like we we thought about we wrote about some of these things and I created a plug-in around this idea so what I do in the coming days as well is like see if the pattern or the paradigm of compound engineering if that applies to co-work can I get that working in co-work because I would be very curious to to expand that uh and see see if it works inside here as well. >> Um Anthony uh I see that you're from Anthropic. Do you want to come on the stream? Um I'm going to send you a link. Uh, I would love to hear what you have to say about this and anything that we should try or anything that's missing. Um, here. Give me a sec. Copy. Let's see. All right. I sent you a stream link. If you want to come on, feel free if you if you're, you know, if you're not feeling it, that's also totally fine. Uh, and yeah, he says it looks or is closer to clothe codes than chats. And it feels like that because all the tools uh like the ask user question tool and stuff like that have a UI which is nice. So you can ask it to say hey can you interview me ask me a few questions and there's like a nice UI with multiple choice and stuff like that. So uh yeah it's really cool that UI >> it is really cool. Um okay so let's keep let's keep looking at this. It's it's still working. One of the things I noticed is when it was erroring, it had it gave an error from cloud code. Like the internal error message is cloud code. So it's it seems like it really is just like a UI wrapper on cloud code rather than a different agent harness or maybe like a cloud SDK. Um Anthony, if if we're wrong about that or anybody else from Enthropic who's who's listening, I'd be very curious for your uh for your thumbs up or thumbs down on that. But that's like interesting design choice not to to use just like actual cloud code. I assume that's because it's already in the app. So, it's like pretty easy. You don't need to use the SDK, but it's a really interesting thing to see. Um, one thing to one thing that I want to show people in case you have not been um watching everything that we're doing at every and if you haven't been, I don't know why you would not. I don't know. I don't know what's wrong with you. But, um, one thing that's really cool that we're that we're thinking a lot about is agent native architectures. Um, and an agent native architecture, this is this app is a really good example. this this new this new cloud co-work app is a really good example of agent native architectures um where we think about agent native architectures as sort of like cloud code in a trench coat uh which means at the bottom of the app instead of having software you have uh like software that works by deterministic rules you have an agent and the agent is wired up to the UI of the app and so when you click a button um it is actually just going to the agent with a prompt and um I think this is a this is a new this is a new way of building applications that we've been working on internally at every if you're interested in that I highly recommend that you uh look at this guide. Um we'll we'll we'll put a link in the chat. Um but this guide goes through how to use or how to build agent native architectures. It's like it's pretty cool and it's like it makes you build stuff like I built this. This is a markdown editor that I built with um this is a markdown editor that I built with cloud code over the weekend. So in the last couple days I built this whole thing. It helps me track. We we use it internally. Um it's called proof. It helps me track um uh when I get a plan from Claude, it helps me track, okay, what things have I approved. So you can see I'm I'm approving things here. So I can track what have I approved, what have I looked at, what's what's done, what's not done. Um and yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of cool stuff here. I'm going to stop blabbing about agent native and go back to Claude. Kieran, anything you want to add here? Um, really what I'm I'm curious for is like as a power user, can I load my own plugins and stuff like that? And there were questions about can we can you do custom MCPS? I think all the MCPS you can do and also this app has access to your machine. So can use Apple script to load things on your machine which is really cool. Um, yeah. And and uh yeah, I'm I'm really curious for how where where does it go? Like clearly it's trying to get cloud codes to the normal user but I think as a power user I would use this as well because in the morning I start up cloud code to make a daily planning like what what am I going to work on for the day but it feels it's probably nicer to do in an app and also if this translates to mobile this is super powerful because you can do more powerful work on your phone that's not necessarily code related. Mhm. >> So yeah, we need to experiment, but there are lots of interesting uh thing. I'm I'm very curious as a power user even though it is the same technology. Maybe it's a new way to use it, which is interesting. >> Yeah. So this is my calendar audit that I asked it to do. So I asked it to audit my calendar and compare it to my goals. Um I reviewed your entire month of calendar activity. So this is something that like regular cloud probably would not do. Um I have a lot of meetings and standups, so that's an interesting one. I actually don't go to a lot of these, so that's probably not fair. And I also have a lot of one-on- ones. I have a lot of um podcasts scheduled, um which I'm starting to get rid of. So, it did it actually did a pretty good job. Um content media, health non-negotiable, blah blah blah. Uh many days have 10 to 15 plus scheduled events. That sounds probably right. Uh this is interesting. It said, \"What are your top priorities?\" I would expect Cloud to know this. I wonder if it has access to all my memories yet because Claude definitely knows like what my priorities are. But anyway, this is pretty cool. I like this. Um, see if it did. Oh, we got we did we got the taxonomy. It's It feels like it's it's like slowly lazy loading all the conversation history. So, it doesn't it's like this isn't happening. This is already this is already done. It just didn't load it. I feel like a lot of the affordances here, they haven't built the statuses yet. So, it's easy to see like, you know, in in the code tab, for example, like I could pretty easily see usually what I've merged and what's waiting for me and stuff. But this is like just an an unorganized list, I guess, by recency. Um, or it's not there's no visual differentiation, which is interesting. Hello, Kate. Our editor-inchief, Kate, is just off camera. Um, Kate, things are going well. We have We've got 2,300 people here. So, >> looking looking at cloud code together. >> That's so exciting. >> Yeah. Uh, oh, you want Okay, let me just >> Yeah, maybe I should try that. Um, if anyone from Anthropic wants to come on the stream and talk to us, I can see you commenting in the chat. I'll send you a link to Streamyard. Just like say yes, I would like to come on the stream and chat. Um, we're very very friendly and I think a lot of people would love to hear from you if you're already here. Um, and I will update the app. This is Yeah, this is actually this is important. I have a beta build right now. So, this is something that um was not I didn't I haven't updated my app and I'm a little afraid to do it on a live stream. Kieran, do you have it in your app? I'm curious. >> I I'm trying to get it working, but it it was down for a while here, but it looks like some it's it's back up again. >> Cool. Anybody have other questions or things they want me to try? I'm taking requests, so ask for ask any interesting queries. Most interesting query uh we'll put in every when we do our vibe check. >> Let's see. I wonder if I could use this to code. I'm kind of like, let's see. Oh, this it did our vis did our audit of uh every the every agent native guide. >> Can you see if it has artifacts as well? If it's similar maybe. Okay, >> it does have it. Well, it didn't do this one in an artifact, but we do have artifacts um in another place. Let me just find it. >> I do the fact that the context is clearly spelled out on the right. >> Yeah, it is. That is nice. So, yeah, context is here. I saw the artifacts tab somewhere. Um yeah, it's just like a friendlier ver it's like a friendlier version of cloud code to me. Um >> yeah, mine is working now as well. >> Uh can you find my every proof uh repo in Cascade projects? Basically, I want you to do a summary of the new feature the the provenence the new feature provenence tracking that I'm I've been building in every proof and write it up in a nice like HTML file artifact that I can send to Kieran to explain to him um how the new provenence is going to work. I think it's this is a combination of something that is kind of it's dev work related, but it's probably not something I would ask Claude Code to do. Um I don't have access to your your Mac file system in his Linux VM environment. Interesting. Uh so that's interesting because it definitely does have as access. Let's see. One of the things that gets confusing about this, I guess, is when it's running on your computer versus when it's not. Like I think it's it's sort of unintuitive to the average person probably that when you're using it in chat, >> it is all online and when you're using it in here, it's actually on your own computer. I'm very curious like how they thought about making that clear from a UX perspective. And if anyone is from Anthropics on this stream, why does it think that it can't access my Mac file system? Oh, maybe I have to add that folder specifically. Oh, yeah, that's what it is. That's so interesting. I just want I just wanted to yolo give it yolo access my file system to be honest with you. >> Um, look at all these projects by the way. This is how you know like I I have a problem. Like these are all vibecoded projects basically. Uh, let's see. Every proof. You know what? It's this one. Okay. Always allow. All right. And now I can The nice thing about Monologue. So Monologue is one of our apps at every is I can just uh there's a shortcut for this. I can just click it and then repaste. Um, and cool. But yeah, what I really want I just wanted to access my whole computer. It has that that's interesting. It has that file cleaning um prompt. I wonder how that works if it can't access my >> Yeah, there. Yeah, there I'm I'm testing it now as well. I'm trying to see if I can use the skills I already have. Can also >> Oh, interesting. >> So, I said organize and tide up my downloads and then it seems like it figured out This is so agent native. It figured out how to select It's as if I selected that folder in the >> um Mhm. >> in the UI. It just because I specifically asked for it. That's cool. I think that's a really smart affordance. It just like I wish it had gotten um activated here too. Like ideally it it knows that I'm trying to access a folder in Cascade projects and it is as if I clicked this. Um are you sure? Um, it's the uh natural version. See if this is actually working. Um, Felix, are you joining? Amazing. Uh, let me just uh find you on the X app. X the everything app. And >> then if you can share my screen, then I can show a short. >> I will do that. Yeah, let me share. >> While you do that, Actually, this is helpful. All right, remove. There you go. You're off to the races. >> Okay, so I was trying this out. Uh, help me generate a VST plugin. Ask me user questions and I found a little bit. So, I found some things. So, basically the ask user question I love because it's this UI. It like runs you through and you can hit one, two, three, four, five, which is very nice. The weird thing is I didn't answer it and it started automatically skipping this. Maybe it's fixed now, but in the other one it started uh automatically uh oh yeah, here skipping. There we go. See, so if your mouse is not on here, it just thinks, oh, this user is not here, so we're going to skip this al together, which is very confusing, but also I love it because I'm a dangerously skip permissions person, and I understand, but it's weird because if you're here scrolled all the way up, it will skip to the next. So, just a little bit uh strange uh here. But the cool part is here. I can say three and it will go and continue. So there's like I like that it keeps keeps going and it's set to like keep going and finish. Um the skip UI here is a little bit weird, but let's say multi-type delay. And you can see uh it's working with my skill uh or skills skills juice. Oh yeah, it is fine. Happy Sharp Hopper is just the local uh place where this is happening. Let's say this. So this is an interface that never existed before, which is cool. Um yeah, there's a it's it's a little bit weird because it's in line here, but in reality, you're answering. So uh I'm sure let's see sending requests. Yeah. So this skipping part is very confusing. I don't know why it's skipping now, but I do like like I would rather say maybe when I start the session what kind of session it is like if if it's a like yolo let's go session or where it like pings me and like very clearly in the co-work tab says like hey you need to answer a question here I need your attention because >> like there's something to be said to both and now it's kind of somewhere in the middle where it's not super clear. So I rather have it say yell at me and say yo I need your your uh I need your input on something and uh I don't want to give input on like creating or using things but like if it if it will change the direction of uh what this will be with the ask user question probably that that is handy to have so far this >> interesting I I have a since we have uh it seems like there are some anthropic people on here I do have a a feeling thing about um ask your user question. I'm I'm curious what you think, Kieran. I just there's a limit to how many characters it displays and then it just goes over and hides the rest of my answer and that just annoys the [ __ ] out of me. Do you know what I'm talking about? >> Yeah, I I know. Yeah, it it needs to be a little bit more flexible also. Like I want like why not 20 options? Like why is five the maximum or something like like sometimes you just have 20 that you need to like I get it but also yeah uh stop questions go build. Uh, so that is nice. Just make it now. Okay. So, it did not really like it's still doing stuff there, but here like it's I mean it's a little bit wonky still, but I love I love the ask user question flow. It's very useful. Um, okay. So, it does it here and you see the to-do right which is here on the right. >> Wait, I was distracted. What plugin are you building here? Can you can you back up just run it? I think about it that way. >> Yeah. Okay. So, I I will I have a skill called the juice skill which knows everything about uh about VST development and I'm creating a I asked can you help me brainstorm a VST uh plugin and we're doing a delay. >> Oh, like it's it's a audio effect. So, digital sound processing that you use in your music making. Yeah. >> And I'm making a delay now and it's building the delay. And like normally normally the building of the delay close code is great for, but sometimes you want to brainstorm. You don't want to build. And that's why I like co-work because I just want to brainstorm a little bit. And the cool part is it has these skills. And >> so yeah, >> uh I want to interrupt you really quick, Kieran, because we have a uh member of the team from Anthropic here on the stream. Felix, welcome. >> Hi, friends. How are you? >> Hey, >> good. How are you? Uh, we've never met before. Tell me about you. What do you like? What do you do at Anthropic? Like, how are you involved in this? >> How am I involved in this? Um, I've been at Anthropic for a little bit, but uh this is the product that my team has built here. We sprinted at this for the last week and a half. Um, what we're trying >> last week and a half. >> That's it. Come on. To be clear, to be clear, I think many people have had the idea that something like cloud code for non-coding work would be helpful and useful to people. And fundamentally, what we want to do here is we do want to help people out with their work like whether that's a personal thing or a corporate thing. And we've had a different number of prototypes in particular before Christmas. But I think over the holidays, one thing we have seen, I'm sure many people have seen this, is that an increasing number of people is using cloud code for almost anything just like we are, right? We're sort of like automating our entire lives with cloud code. So we were thinking what is a small early thing that we can try out and ship to people and iterate with them together to really figure out what is the right what is the right user experience, what is the right thing aim to build. >> Um, and this is it. This is the the sort of like research preview, very early alpha, a lot of like a lot of like rough edges as you've already seen, right? There's a lot of things about it that I think we're going to improve very quickly. >> Um, but this is our attempt to like build in the open and work together with people out there. >> I love it. Tell us about like some of the design decisions you made like an an early one for example is there's a third tab instead of uh maybe adding a co-work mode into the chat tab. like how did you think about um and what was the process to to uh to come to the the design that you have currently for how the product works? >> Uh it's a great question. So I think I think one belief I have is that the current user interface that you see across agentic applications not just anthropic but across the industry is probably going to change pretty dramatically in about a year or two. Right now we have these hyper specialized individual input fields and we have a lot of custom scaffolding around the specific task that you're going to do. But as we see the intelligence of models improve and as we also like maybe holistically as an industry figure out a little bit of the generalization problem I expect that we're actually going to see a smaller number of interfaces for a wider range of use cases. >> For now what we're doing is the reason we broke it out is because we want to be pretty transparent that this separate thing is a construction site, right? Are we sort of letting you into our kitchen? We want to like work together with you. We want to ship almost every single day some new features, some bug fixes, try out some things. So, this separate tab is fairly experimental. It's you could say on the frontier or the bleeding edge, but it's just a little bit a little bit less polished and a little faster pace. And that's one of the main reasons why separate tab. There are some technical reasons too I could tell you like one of them is that currently this is running on your computer. So, your chats are local. they're not shared with other devices. Um, we're being being a little bit more aggressive in harmony agentic capabilities, forgive cloud. Um, those are the main reasons. >> How did you think about because I feel like that's such a huge UX hurdle to get over. How did you think about letting people know, hey, this is actually running on your computer versus chat, which is in the same application, is not. Yeah, that seems so hard. >> Yeah. I think the dream that I have and I'm I'm sure many people have this dream. The dream that I have is that it doesn't really matter, right? Like where your code runs it's should be technical implementation detail and it should matter to people as much as when you visit the New York Times.com like is it using websockets or not, right? And it's like who cares? >> Um I think for us right now it's an opportunity to move a little bit faster >> and to ship a little bit quicker and also like work a little bit closer with the people for whom we're building this. I have this strong belief that it's very hard to figure out a great product in isolation by yourself, right? You sort of like go up into a cave and you work on something for a year and eventually comes out. >> I I think it's really hard to build a good product that way. Um, and I often like to remind people that like even the first iPhone was missing missing a bunch of things that we sort of consider to be table stakes. Um, so yeah, I think it's a pretty big hurdle. Um, but we're okay with that for now because we do want people who are signing up for this, right, to like sign up for it fairly intentionally. >> Yeah, I think that's a really interesting pattern is like uh let's ship really fast and we'll ship it as a new thing in the app that maybe fewer people will click on um so that we can get it out in the open and start iterating together rather than like try to make it perfect. especially in this new world where it says you said you were working on this for a week and a half, this version for a week and a half, which is kind of insane. Um, Kieran, do you have any questions? >> Yeah, I'm I'm curious. Um, like clearly this is the version that's out now, but like what is the version like in your head? Like what are the like where where where do you want to go next or like what are the things you're dreaming about? you you use the word dream >> like what are those things where you wanna want to go what is because I'm sure everyone on the team had like wild ideas and then you were like no we need to ship Monday so let's just like what are if you can share any of those would love to hear those >> I I love that question so much because I think I actually have the same question for the two of you right which is where do you want this to go what do you want to do um I've already heard you say you kind of want to give it to access to entire computer um the multiple choice thing where you're like actually can we like shift around a little bit on how we want to want to do this. I think right now I am much more in a mode of okay, let's see what people think and then try out a billion things. Some of them will probably be the wrong thing, some of them will be the right thing. But I think it's much more interesting to me what people want to do with this rather than like what's my own personal dream or vision. >> And in the things that I've sort of built in the past, this was always this was always the thing that happened, right? You have like an idea of how people will use the thing that you build. they actually find a use for it in all these other ways and then you lean into that. So, I'm really hoping that I'm really hoping that we can learn a lot about what do people want, what do people not want, what do they like, what do they dislike. I'm sure people will like dislike a few things about this and then we like adjust and like iterate on it. >> That's really cool thing about a go fork here. >> Yeah. So Boris is very good in building cloth code in a way that people can figure out what they want. Like is there a way like do you use that strategy in a in a way as well where we where you give some building blocks or things for us like for example can I include my own plugins or skills or like is there a way for people to experiment inside co-work as well in the like maybe the non-coding way or is it really like this is the product it's that's what it is like how because there's a cool balance between like how cloth code works and people that use it because it's super hackable. Like is there a similar philosophy in co-work as well for non-coders? >> Yeah. Like very composable, right? Like >> the the the first thing you said about like Boris being very good at steering cloud code in this direction of shipping early and then iterating on it and seeing how people use it. Um it's really funny that you mentioned that because I think one of the reasons we've shipped today, maybe shipped a little earlier was because Boris pushed me and was like, \"Hey, you should probably show this to people. See see what they And on the composable piece, I think the the thing that I found most impressive in my own work over the last couple of weeks and maybe sort of the last two months is that I'm really leaning into skills. So instead of like previously writing MCP tools or like this like very specific harness that is like very tailored towards just claude, I instead just write skills. Sometimes I still write a binary and then I describe in a skill how to do something, right? I'm like what's a good example? Um, I'm working on like a marathon training plan for myself and I wrote a little binary that fetches all my athletic activities from various pages. But then I just write in markdown in a skill file. Hey Claude, if you want to if you want to make a training plan like please follow the following guidelines. >> Um, we do automatically load any skill you have installed in Claude AI into co-work and I think that's probably going to be increasingly especially as well as get smarter and especially with Opus 45. >> It is so good at following skills. So skills is probably the primary hackable surface that I'm exploiting right now. >> That's great. Um, one thing you said earlier in the conversation is you're you think that there's going to be fewer like UI services. Does that does that mean that like over time there'll be fewer UI UI services. Does that mean because there's a lot of debate over the last couple years about is chat the final form factor for AI and everyone was like no we need more UI. Are you is that are you putting your stake in the ground as um natural language actually is here to stay and we're going to have fewer UI services where you just talk to an agent maybe an agent orchestrator that goes and talks to a bunch of other agents and um that's the kind of form factor you're you're pushing towards. So it looks a little bit like how cloud code does today. >> Yeah, I think this is still very heavily debated and there's certainly no anthropic viewpoint. I I'm not even sure that there's a viewpoint that my fairly small team would like holistically agree with, right? I think people have very different visions about how will people interact with a AI and models in the future. If you ask me very personally, I think I believe two things. One is that the chat input and its various forms, not just for models, but in general, right? like the idea of there's a text box and you put into the text box what you want. Um, if you generalize it enough to say even google.com or the address bar in Chrome is like a I want something input box. I think that is going to stick around for much longer than we all think. That's the first thing I think. I think there's we will continue to have something that looks like a search I want something box. >> But the second question is like how many separate boxes do you have, right? Like do you have one box for code? Do you have another box for maybe like your personal entertainment? Do you have another box for healthcare related concerns? I'm not sure we're going to have too many boxes of those. And there too, maybe I would go back to Google. Um I think I sort of remember the early 2000s where you did a different search box for every single Google subroduct. And increasingly you just type what you want into your Chrome search bar and you don't no longer actually like go to subpage or sub like I'm in the mode right now of looking specifically for a shopping thing. So I go to Google shopping. Um yeah, and I would be surprised if we don't see a similar generalization that is smarter about figuring out what you want to do in the future. We might still have different interfaces where it sort of like splits out, right? And understand, oh, I understand that you're trying to do X, therefore I'm going to show you UI for X. But the entrance point >> I think yeah the interesting counterpoint to that is something like Microsoft Excel which I think it also has some similarities to the way that um um you know just generally AI works is it's this general purpose product. It's super simple to get started. You can make things really like endlessly complex with Excel and then Excel sort of spawned this the B2B SAS wave like you probably don't get B2B SAS without Excel. So there's I think there's also the other argument that you have these sort of general um really general tools and then people find power workflows within them that then get split out. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think I think Excel is like such a beautiful example of so many things because it's like for many developers something that sort of exists a little bit on the periphery, right? Um I've often heard the analogies between like how many daily daily active users Excel has versus like how many developers even exist on the planet. Um it's an interesting number and I think I think the thing that I find interesting about Excel and the you know the commitment it has from its power users is that those power users are not too interested in marginal productivity gains or marginal UI or UX gains over deep familiarity with a product. Right? I think that's interesting. I think there's a lesson there in some shape or form and I think I've I've actually seen that across like various other surfaces where you as a developer sometimes look at someone's workflow and you say oh I can make this workflow like slightly better for you if I make you a specific >> use case tool over here on the side and then people sort of fail to adopt that thing because they're actually more comfortable doing specific things within their product. Um, as an example, I think that's a lesson that I have learned. I was previously at Slack for many years and that's a lesson that I've learned there over and over again is that you can make these separate surfaces that you think might serve people's use cases much better, but they will continue to just do it in chat. >> That's a really really good lesson. I love that. Um, speaking of speaking of that, I think there's there's today is for the non-developers, but I feel like there's a lot of developers who are watching this right now, and you're someone who's if you if you you built this, so like you're you're deep into how to build like agent native applications. And this is something that we've been thinking about and talking about a lot at every um we just published a guide called agent native architectures. And we've been thinking about like what are the core principles of agent native apps and I'm really curious if these resonate with you if you think they're wrong or if there are things that you would add that are part of how you guys at Anthropic think about building agents. So an example is um par. So one of the things that we think about when we build agents internally at every is whatever the user can do through the UI the agent should be able to do. Um, and I see that a little bit. That's basically how cloud code works. But, um, I see that a little bit in in what you built with co-work, for example, if you didn't pick the file picker, uh, it'll automatically determine that you are asking it to pick a particular folder and it will do that for you without you having to touch the UI. So, that would be an example of par. Another another one is granularity which is basically tools should be uh mostly at a lower level than features and the feature should live in the prompt or the skill so that you can combine tools in new ways that you didn't predict previously. Um and then that allows for the third one which is composability which is um you can combine you can combine those new ways and you get the the fourth one which is emerging capabilities. So people are just doing it for stuff that you didn't expect. Um, and you met you see the latent demand and then you like build for that. And that's this is essentially I think like a lot of my summary of how cloud code works. I'm curious if like how this sounds to you and if you think that there we're missing anything or or there are any things that you've learned from doing this in production at a huge scale that um could make it make people better at building these kinds of applications. >> I think this really resonates with me, right? And like I think one thing that's hidden in emerging capabilities is the the inability I think especially individuals and silo teams have to predict how an agent actually ends up being super useful if you give it fairly primitive tools. >> I think pushing down tools into like a general space is very powerful. Like the more composable they become, the more generalizable the more generalizable the tool is, the more you will benefit from improvements on model intelligence. And I think for for many developers that I've been talking to in the past, it seems like the rate at which model intelligence and models ability to call tools effectively improves is actually much faster than your ability to like maybe churn out additional tools and like educate users on them. Um, and I think if you if you sort of take a step back and you think how can I build a very generalizable tool, you have a much better chance to build something that can adapt to new use cases. So I think that resonates with me quite a bit. Mhm. >> What about the like trade-offs? Like I've been talking to Kieran about the trade-offs in tools. Kieran, do you want to talk about the what you're kind of what you noticed in Kora and what you're thinking about? >> Yeah. So, I I think putting things in a prompt uh is great and then having the tools, but there's like we need to now suddenly create tools that then read skills or something like that. So like we have to invent this meta layer like skills is like just in time prompt injection but like we need to create that thing and now everyone that's building stuff unless you use cloth code uh or the cloth SDK it's all built but like it's this thing like now there's like this struggle of like oh but like tools are that you can describe stuff in the tool or you create a tool that then wraps around it and then calls something else. So there's like this h this friction there and like it is great to make things composable like if originally you create for example like five tool calls want to search email like read email this and this and this but you can also say no we do just do like an execute tool call and we create skills that can do those things or an MCP or some abstraction there. So um there's like this change happening and obviously this is like the cloth code is like uh and the cloud SDK is a very good uh push for that but I feel friction there. I'm sure you felt that friction too. So maybe you have some best practices for people that are stuck in the old-fashioned AI world and need to go to the more agent native uh uh things that you learned or that you've noticed uh because you've implemented on top of I I assume cloud SDK >> maybe or some very like there is so you use that and you implement things on top. So I'm very curious if you learned anything there. I'm not sure that I have any like wisdom from the mountain that is going to be more valuable than yours. But I think I think what you're saying >> I think what you're saying that resonates with me is that you sort of need to make a call, right? like which part of the outputs do you want to be non-deterministic and where are you comfortable where you're comfortable relying on model intelligence and every single time you do rely on model intelligence if you pick a cheaper model or like a dumber model then those parts also go down in quality >> and I I like to break up my workflows into like the non-deterministic and the repeatable parts I think the more repeatable something is and the more more easily I can say this will never change and if you get smarter I'm not going to benefit here at all Um, I think that's a place where where it might make sense to like write a tool. And in a sense, we're already doing that, right? Like we're not implementing you you could give cloth a very generalizable write assembly code tool, right? We could be like just call GCC and figure out whatever you want, but but we don't, right? We give it like um, >> right? Because >> that's that's ideal. >> That's the most granular you can get. Yeah. >> Yeah. But I will say I will say that I think when I talk to developers out there and depending on depending on how sci-fi you are, I think even that assumption is a little bit I wouldn't bet too much money on it. That assumption is certainly under attack. Like the idea of like should you give Claude any tool at all or should it just be like a Claudia's memory, start writing ones and zeros, go wild. Um it's it's it's an interesting area. It's like hard for me to know right now. Um, >> no one knows but but you you learned stuff. You created skills for exactly this reason because you needed more than just a slash command and a sub agent and you were like we there we yeah like we need the cloth MD to be better but like it's it like I guess that's why skills ex like were created and clearly that's working well. I resonate with you saying like skills are amazing. This is also like I'm creating skills every day and I love them. So, so clearly there's something there. But when when do you like >> when when do you not have it be a skill or like I it's it's it's very interesting to me. >> You know, I think this is this is such a fun conversation. Who someone you should actually talk to at some point is Barry. Um because Barry is the one who is at least inside the company sort of like our salesperson. is the person who essentially came up with skills and for us fundamentally skills were a little bit of a byproduct of the same tension that you're describing. So what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a very easy way for people inside the company to get dashboards right and um we have a we use one of the popular data providers where we keep a lot of our data and we were trying to figure out okay do we build really specific tools that fetch that data and then compress it down into like a specific format. Um the first couple of dashboards cloth in the building looked a little you know this was before 4.5 the dashboards were not ideal every third or fourth dashboard it generated was like a little lackluster. Um so we we did think about okay do we like super parameterize it and basically build like a fixed dashboard that cloud then only plucks new data into. Um but in that process while building that we sort of discovered hey if you just tell cloud how to effectively query this data source that it can use SQL and that it please follows the following design guidelines for making dashboards suddenly you get something very very good and you get it very good every single time and then you also give people and this is the emerging capabilities part then you also give people the opportunity to say hey Claude I understand that you're following these principles for dashboards but I also want I don't know different chart type or I want to combine it with other data And that's then where things really open up, right? >> That is really interesting. I feel like the one one way to talk about why you might want to skill instead of just having it have GCC and just everything is just in time is it's like about sharing something repeatable with other people that you can talk about. Um, and there is something actually not not everything should be just in time because you want to do the same thing over time with a group of people. Um, and that's that's kind of a skill I guess. >> Yeah. Does that make sense? >> Yeah. And that's sort of how we operate too as humans, right? Like when I join the companies, no one tells me how to book a flight. Like >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Internal tool. How do you get a room? >> I think a lot of us sort of operate even as humans on a long list of markdown files with stuff in it. >> Um, Felix, uh, I I want to give you an option. You've been very generous with your time. I want to give you an option to to hop off if you want. We would love to keep chatting. We have endless questions, but I'm sure you have a lot a lot going on. Uh, do you need to do you need to go or do you want to do you want to keep chatting? >> I think this is a good time for me to bounce. But I'm not going to go before both of you give me like one thing you would like us to change. >> Uh, I mean my my easy one is just yolo access to my whole computer. >> Okay. Okay. >> Um, and uh, and make it easier for me to know whether it's working on my computer or working in the cloud on a chat and make it easy for me to use it on mobile. Okay. >> Yeah. Plus one on the model. But my favorite thing would be uh the ability to add my plugins. So just my I have a marketplace with plugins. I just want to hook it up to GitHub and >> Fair enough. Yeah. Yeah. >> Like because now I'm like adding things in the app and then copying it there and like it's like I'm like it probably I can just copy it somewhere but like just native support for a marketplace and then adding it and syncing it. It would be absolutely great. Thank you. I appreciate both of those quite a bit. We're going to take those back going to tell the team about it and um for everyone else on the chat like find us on the internet, send us what you think. We're quite interested in hearing from people and adjusting our road map. >> Thank you so much, Felix. Thanks for building for joining. >> Thank you. >> Have a good one. All right, that was awesome. So cool. >> Thank you. Yeah. >> And we have so many people on this stream. There's almost 10,000 people here. Oh my god. Um, if you're joining us for the first time, uh, we just had, uh, Felix on. Felix is a member of the techn technical staff at Anthropic and he was talking to us about Claude Co-work. If you are view looking at this, uh, this stream, then you probably know what Claude Co-work is, but I will share my screen and show you again in case you're um, uh, in case you're wondering. It is a new version of Claude that's sort of like Claude code for nontechnical people. It looks a little bit like this. Uh we've been testing it at every we're the only subscription you need to stay at the edge of AI. Every.TO. We get access to this stuff before it comes out. And we do vibe checks like this. We do them live. We also write them on every.to. So we had we got this earlier today. So we were just testing it out. Um here's an example of a task I gave it. And you'll notice it looks a lot like u normal claude, like the normal Claude chat. um the the differences are are a bit subtle but I think that they um it it does make a big difference. So instead of a chat you have tasks. Um when you when you look at the you know this for this query or maybe like uh let me find a better example of this uh like this query for example you'll see that claw the like uh co-work ran for a really long time. If I asked the same query, I wanted to go to our every agent native guide and walk through it to do do a UX review. Um, Claude would have stopped after a couple turns and given me a pretty good answer. But this does a lot more research. So, because it's working on your computer, it's going to be able to work for a long time. And I think that's that's sort of the key thing that you can take away from when you might want to use co-work and and how co-work might work differently than regular claude which is um for the first time if you're non-technical you can ask uh your computer to do something and walk away for a while. Uh and then you can you can also ask it to do many things in parallel. So this is an experience that if you're using cloud code, you have a lot with programming. But I think most nontechnical people are still in the kind of like turnbyturn era of using uh using chat and just expecting a response almost immediately. And this is much more of an uh built to be an async experience for non-coding tasks like you know data analysis or research or writing documents like all that kind of stuff. Um, like Felix said, they built this in a week and a half. Um, which is crazy. >> Crazy. >> Which is the new normal, by the way. So, anyone who's like coming up with the PRD in two weeks, nope. You ship the whole thing in a week and a half. >> 100%. So, there are some rough edges here. Um, but they're going to be improving them really quickly. I think it's I think it's really cool. The the pattern that I he shared that I really think is interesting is I was kind of asking why even add a new tab. um uh like a co-work tab and he said we just needed we essentially needed a playground to like mess around and do stuff that is a little bit less polished and so it's nice to have have this extra tab which is an interesting pattern in AI where now you can build so quickly. I think we need more patterns for for what to do with that. Um Kieran any reflections from from our conversation with him or anything you're thinking about right now? >> Yeah, I think I think it's like why use co-work over chat or code? I think that is always my first question and I think if you're a nontechnical user uh just think of co-work as something that is chat. Just try coowork as the new version of chat, the better version or a different flavor and just open it and do the same things you've been doing in chat but you see that it is different and you can do things like one really really important thing is in chat if it is responding you cannot send a new message when it does something you're like oh wait that's wrong with co-work you can cue a message and like while it's working say something new. So like just those tiny things are very very handy. So just try co-work instead of chat. It has skills like you can generate documents, Excel sheets, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs like it can do all of those things. So um if you are applying to jobs like just upload everything and say hey can you rewrite my uh resume for this job and uh like try it out like things you would manually do normally. And also connect Rome uh you can enable it maybe you can share you can show that how to do that then in connections >> uh yeah so if you go into your settings and go into I guess it's is it connectors or is it >> Mhm. >> It's in connectors >> here control chrome. >> Yeah. >> So you can you can add that in there and then it'll just be able to basically use Chrome on your computer which is really cool. I mean, one of the things I had it do uh that is totally new and interesting is do I have it? I had it go through my my Twitter feed, my X feed, and I asked it to just like tell me what was hot right now. Uh what are people talking about? And that's really cool. Like that's that's ordinarily something that you would have had to pay a lot of money for an API for. And this can just do that without really a problem, which I love. I love that. Oh, here it is. >> And yeah, and if you use Chrome and you're logged in on things in Chrome, it's already there. So, you don't need to log in again. It just uses your Chrome itself. Yeah, >> exactly. And I use Atlas, so I had to log in all this stuff. But if you use Chrome, it's great. Um, so like look, this it just it just read my Twitter feed. That's so cool. It's a there's there's so many possibilities if you're a writer or a marketer or anyone that does research, especially research on things that don't have APIs, um that you can now do with without much trouble. And to your point earlier, Kieran, like when you're thinking about, okay, what would I even use this for? I think that one one of the things that we try to embody at every is we try to be really curious and know that if you're trying new technology for the first time, the first five things you do probably aren't going to work. But there's like a really there's something really fun about being curious right now because um Felix, for example, the guy who made this, doesn't even know how we're going to use it. um he needs people like us, anyone who's watching this stream to like mess around with it and figure out all the all the new interesting emergent ways that it could be used so that he can make the product better. So it's the first time where the software developer is more like setting up a playground but has no idea how the playground's going to be used and the users are the ones that are being creative and figuring out things to do. And so if you've if you approach this with curiosity, it's like a huge opportunity over the next couple weeks to like figure out what this is for. I think another um another important thing is people tend to have this thing that I like to call capability blindness, which is I tried this once before, three months ago. It's never going to work with AI. And the really interesting thing about AI is like it changes every couple months. like I freaking like Opus 45 just totally changed everything. Um the stuff that had never worked before starts started working now. And so if there's something that you really want AI to do, like for me that's that has always been I wanted to do copy edits. We should see if it can do copy edits. I'm going to set that up. Um, so I've always wanted to do copy edits and every time something new comes out, I just try it because I know at some point in the next couple months, it's going to start working. So I'm going to actually set that up. I think that would be a really fun demo. Kieran, do you want to um do you want to talk about what anything on your mind so that I can take a little bit of time and make the make get the copy edit set up? >> Yes. >> I'll share mine here. I'll just share a screen here. So yeah, if you share my screen. >> Oh, sorry. Yeah, >> your screen. >> Forgot that you were uh that I was you could see my screen. Okay, >> we're professionals, everyone. >> Yes, obviously >> we started live streaming last week. Give us some slack. Yeah. Um, cool. Yeah. So, we talked about skills a lot. Uh, you might think like, what the hell is a skill? Um, isn't that just a prompt? Yeah, it's a prompt, but it's also more uh it's more like uh Yeah. Yeah. And and what can you do with it? So, uh this is the most hackable way for co-work. So, if you want to personalize your co-work experience, this is the way Anthropic says. So, I asked what are all the skills I have and how can you use them? So, for example, these are document creation skills and it just learns how to create Excel sheet. And these are some of my own. Uh I I love Swiss design. So I have like a Swiss design uh scale a Gemini image gen where you can uh get nano banana images inside bold code. Um I have a dhh ruby style uh to roast my code and yeah all all these things. So I just create skills for everything. So uh I have a 3D print skill where I needed to print some 3D things and I was like I'm sure cold codes can do this. Um a and so I created a skill and and these skills normally what I do is I go to chat and uh like say um can you generate a uh can you deep research how Dan Shipper writes? So for example, if I like Dan's writing, I might uh do this and actually >> I don't know that guy's kind of a blowhard. >> I know. So normally what I do is I enable deep research here and go hard and it run deep research runs for like an hour sometimes which is great and then I say um can you create a skill for this? So I'll just fake do this but uh then I create a skill for this and there is this thing in claude in capabilities that you can enable which is really cool the example skills. So you go to capabilities example skills and there's a skill creator from anthropic. If you enable this after you did deep research or anything you can say create a skill out of this. Obviously you can do that here as well. So you can uh do research in co-work and create a skill out of this and it will be loaded inside uh inside here. So for example now um can you design with Swiss design a very beautiful chair for me and create a STL so that I can 3D print this miniature 4 cm high so let's see so I do this and it shoot them uh KU design uh okay so hopefully it's uh yeah so it's loading the two skills here you can see the context it pulled in the Swiss design skill scale and the 3D print scale. Uh, so I like that that you can really clearly see this. Um, and what it does, the skill will just inject a prompt where it says just do these things. Uh, make it look good. Uh, don't be no, don't use inter or whatever. This is the aesthetics. So, it's now doing things. And there is also in skills you can put uh like scripts, Python scripts, whatever script you want, binary scripts, uh uh anything you want to run. H so if you want something programmatic, you can encapsulate that into a script and put it in a skill. So every time it runs for example if you want to check if it's the shape or if it's following the certain uh uh like static or if it's actually linting well you can encapsulate all that in the scale and trigger it as well. So it's now doing this which is really cool. Um and the scale will create a STL file uh which I can then 3D print. So, we'll see. Like a chair obviously is maybe a little bit hard, but uh why not? So, this this is how you can create your version of co-work with skills. So, you can capture and find the things you do and encapsulate uh your style and everything you do into a skill and then have it available here. What is cool here is on the right side you can see the STLs out. Uh the preview uh there's a preview. Let's look at the preview. Okay. So, it's a little bit hacky still because or here the side. There we go. Okay. This is the chair. Beautiful. Uh, so this is SVG. It's not 3D. Let's see. Can we can we look at this? No, we cannot look at this. But yeah, we have a STL. Um, see if I can open this. Open in Bamboo Studio. I'll see if this looks any good. And I'll share my other screen. Share screen. And then we go to Dan. So here >> is my Swiss design chair. >> Amazing. We need the skill. Kieran, give us the skill. >> Uh oh. Yeah. So the the actually the 3D skill is is on my machine, but I'll I'll share it. I'll push it to the uh to the interwebs. And that was actually my request to >> uh yeah to Felix is like can I automatically uh like pull these things into my uh my uh coding experience or like in co-work that I if I push them online. So yeah I will share this but uh it's yeah make your own things uh go wild and it's kind of funny to uh then print this. I'll print it and take a picture later. >> I love it. Um, so I uh if if you have just joined, one of the things that we're talking about with cloud co-work, I think that one of my bars for AGI is can it do copy edits in a Google doc? Like it's surprisingly hard to get these things to do that. So u what we have at every obviously we publish every single day. We have a very um high bar for the copy that we publish and we want to make sure everything is like really really clean and beautiful. And so we have a skill that's in Claude that is our every proofreader skill. And what I wanted what I wanted to do is see can Claude co-work copyedit a Google doc. So this is a Google doc. This is an article that we published um last week uh by Katie Parrot who's one of our writers who's fantastic. She's going to be the one writing the vibe check on co-work for later today. So look out for that um on every every.TO. So I just said like okay I have an every proofreader file. I just downloaded the skill file and gave it gave it to it in documents. Can you go to this Google doc and make edits that suggest changes? Um, and then uh this is actually really interesting. So like it's just hard for AIS to do this because it has to go through the the the copy editor and just look for every for each rule in the copy editor. It has to go through every part of the document and find all the violations and that's just like really hard to do. But you can see I said go do this. This is not something that I don't think that the regular cloud app could really do this. Maybe Claude if if he used it in Chrome could, but um other than that it could not do it. You can see it loaded the document. Um it's getting all the text. It's scrolled through the whole document and uh it's now clicking on it looks like it's clicking on suggesting. Let me see if I could actually find the Chrome tab that it has opened. Yep. So you can see that it's uh here's what it's doing. It is did it go? It it successfully got itself into suggesting mode. And now what it looks like is it's searching using find and replace for errors that it found. And we'll see now I need to double click on editor and chief to select it and type the replacement. Let me triple click near to select and manually make the edit. This is so interesting. Um I feel like watching this is like watching a video game. I'm like >> oh yeah, come on. >> Yeah, it's really entertaining. Yeah. >> Yeah. But Google Google Docs is like the final boss of stuff for AIS to use because it's just like so it's such ultimately such a simple application, but it's the way that they built it is so complicated. It's like not actually real HTML. It's like a whole it's just just really hard. So, um yeah, it's just struggling. So, if you're at Anthropic and you're watching this, if you could please improve your computer use to actually be able to use Google Docs, that would like totally change my life and change the life of Kate, our editor-inchief, and a bunch of other people here. So, um, yeah, please, please do that. Um, everything about AI is like a video game. Absolutely true, Kieran. Go for it. >> Yeah. So I I'm thinking so we have this skill but is it like skills can be maybe optimized now to actually make use of sub agents and things like that that maybe were never available. So it might be also time to rewrite our skills a little bit. Uh if you created skills uh for cloth m maybe we can push it to use sub agents or you execute scripts more or like do some things in a programmatic way. So there might be an opportunity also to do more of that. Yeah. >> Katie Parrot who wrote this article says, \"Surely this is the cleanest copy that has ever copied.\" It's true. It's probably hasn't found many errors because Katie, you didn't make any. Um, but we'll we'll see. It's It's still working on editor-inchief with dashes. >> It's doing something. >> Thank god this is working. This is able to work async because if I had to like we were actually, you know, looking over the over it shoulder for forever, it would it would not be uh particularly useful. >> Yeah, we'll do a live stream or Claude should do live streams of it doing work. Yeah. >> Yeah, actually that'd be really fun. Claude doing work.tv >> and then see it mess up. Yeah. >> Uh here I'm gonna give it a hint. Hey buddy. Um you can just type in there and replace it. You don't have to use find and replace. Let's see if it This is >> so Yeah. Yeah. You saw then do that. Yeah. >> Yeah. This is another thing that like that this does that is different from if you're using the chat which is you can see this button says Q add to Q. And this is going to be a lot the UX of this is a lot more like the UX in um cloud code where you can just send messages even if it's working and it'll deal with the messages. You don't have to wait for it to respond to your last one. And I think that's really that's really really good important for um async conversations. And we got our first compact. The the bane of every claude app user's existence is compact. >> Um so we'll see coming up after the break. >> We'll see if we'll see if can replace editor-inchief with dash >> or forgot what it was doing and does something completely different. We'll see. So, one one thing it says Q, which is a little bit confusing because Q in my head would mean like do this after you finish the one before. >> Yeah. >> But it's actually a little bit smarter. If you say, \"Yo, stop stop what you're doing. This is terrible.\" Like it will actually look at the text and think like, \"Hey, do I need to change anything what I'm doing right now?\" So, it it does like either pick it up immediately or if it's like after this do this, it will actually cue it. So there is a little bit more flexible than just like injecting it. It will look at it whenever you add it which is uh good to understand as well. >> I wonder if CL is getting performance anxiety because it knows that 13,000 people are watching it. Okay, dude. >> Oh, I thought it was 13 people >> are watching this. Please just type. You're so close. Um, if you if you want more uh extremely sight uh smart and insightful takes on AI, you should subscribe to Every. Every is the only subscription you need to stay at the edge of AI. It's every.TO. Um we uh we have a pretty cool business. We do um ideas apps and training at the edge of AI. So on the idea side, we have a daily newsletter. We get our hands on um we get our hands on stuff like like Claude co-work on the day that these things come out. We do we do vibe checks which tell you from our team uh as we're using these in our day-to-day life and work. Um what is it good for? What it's not not good for? That that uh happens for products. It happens for new models. So like when Opus 45 came out, we had a review on the day of. I can show you that. Uh we also develop apps ourselves. So, I I'll I'll talk about the apps in a second, but this is the article that we wrote on the day that Opus45 came out. This is by Katie. Again, Katie, this is Katie's article by Kieran and by me. And um if you've been seeing all of the um like hype about Cloud Code and Opus45, we started talking about it November 24, 2025, the day it came out, and we said it's the coded coding model we've been waiting for. It took people about a month to catch up to that. So if you really really want to know um if you really want to know what's going on at the edge of AI, it's really good. I mean I'm biased but I think it's I think this is a really good read and our vibe checks are really good. We also have apps. So uh we have four apps that we build as part of every we have one called Kora which which Kieran builds which is an AI email assistant. Corora.computer. Um we have one called monologue which is a speechtoext app. You can see monologue right here. This is monologue. I'm talking and it will type in here. Um, I don't want to mess up our our buddy Claude. Um, but it's sort of like Whisper Flow or Super Whisper. Um, and oh, it copied it to the keyboard. You see it? It just uh pasted my text in there. Uh, we've got a couple other ones. Spiral, which is a a go an agentic ghost writer, and Sparkle, which is a file manager, file cleaner. And, uh, it's all available for one subscription. So you pay one price and you get access to all the ideas. So everything that we write, all the apps, so four AI apps, AI apps at the edge of AI and training. So we have um camps that you can go to. We're doing a cursor camp um where the team from cursor is joining us uh in a couple in a couple days uh and you get to learn directly from the cursor team. You saw we had Felix from Anthropicon earlier. Uh we do these all the time. We we basically teach you how we build. So everyone at every is a builder and a writer and as we're using these tools like cloud co-work and cloud code to build apps and do writing and do design and all that kind of stuff we bring you along for the ride. You should subscribe every um and we're still on this extremely scintillating view of claude trying to make make uh suggested changes in a Google doc. And I think we can call we can call this one just we need a a copyedit google doc copyedit benchmark and it has it has failed. That benchmark is sat is not saturated. Um we're still not agi folks. So stay tuned for hopefully the next model. Anthony Morris from Anthropic. Huge fan of Kora. I love to hear that. Kieran. Doesn't that make you feel good? >> Yes. Yeah. We have a few anthropic peeps using it. >> That's pretty great. >> Thank you. >> Yeah. Um Karen, what's on your mind? >> Um I think on my mind is I want to try this out. This makes me very excited. Like this this feels like something that was missing. Even as a coder, I want to use this. So like if you are using cloth code probably this is easier for you to use. >> Um and I really want to just see what it can do, how we can use it in our daily lives. I would love iOS integration like it like scheduling things it pushing things to my phone like me chatting with it like and also one one thing that looks like it's not super present now is like storage so currently you can store or connect it to your local computer but what if you're on your phone is there some persistence like there are projects in the chat uh side but there are no projects in the the co-work site. So like I'm very curious how to use this. But what I love is it hooks into the skills and things I already have. So what I'm going to do is just whenever I would have started up a chat window, I'm now going to start up a co-work window and just see how it behaves and goes and just yeah go from there. >> Yeah, I think that's a good I think that's a good one. Okay, so we're going to have to write the vibe check in a few and probably also do some other work. Um, I am curious if you had to give this a rating. So, when we do vibe checks, we have red, yellow, green, and then we have a gold med metal for paradigm shifting. So, when we when we did Opus 45, I think you and I were both at the paradigm shift level >> for for comparison. I think um for GBT 5, I was a I was a yellow I was a yellow green and you were a yellow, I think, when it first launched. Right. So, where do you put this if you had to give it a red, yellow, green, or a gold medal? >> I I would rate it from just playing with it. Uh you like the UI and like execution, I would say yellow because it's kind of janky. >> Yeah. >> But but it's very interesting. Like it's it like like we can say what we want, but like it is kind of janky. But that's what they said. We we made this to try out and like I see Anthropic is very very good at listening to people. I'm sure like someone on the team here saw me click something or you do something, they're already pushing changes to this uh because that's how fast they go. Uh but from an like from uh an idea I would say green because I I really think we should experiment more with the interface what it is and like giving this cloth code moment to more people like having more people that do normal work also starts to feel a par paradigm shift of like async work and really handing something to an agent and I think this could be that because I don't see any other company uh do it like this and obviously cloth is very uh yeah like it's a very good harness so like let's milk it let's make it better but I would say ID green uh execution today right now yellow >> yeah I I think that's I think that's spot on and but like to to to your point Anthony uh Morris just said I have a PR up already from something Dan said so yes wall. >> Exactly. Yeah. So that's why we do these. >> Yeah. >> Welcome to the anthropic product meeting happening live on X uh with your friendly neighborhood uh product testers. Um and yeah, I think that I think that's that's totally right. They're moving super fast. I I love how I love that there's already going to be changes in the product from this. So for anyone who's watching or listening, you should give more feedback. Do it in the chat. Um send it send it to people on on X. um they really actually are do iterate pretty quick and I think that it's fine that this is a yellow um and I I the the way that I think about it is obviously there's a cloud code moment on X over the last couple weeks and like that was the thing that they immediately just like shipped something like how many how many founders were like building a cloud code for um cloud we were calling it cloud code easy mode because it was undeal we were we were batting around um internally at every two and Uh, and they just built it. They just went ahead and built it. And I think that's that's so cool and it shows they really have their finger on the pulse of what people want. That's that's the thing that I think is good about a lot of anthropic stuff is you can tell they use it >> themselves. Um, and they're using it in a very AI native and agent native way. >> Absolutely. Yeah. They they get it and but they're also listening like they get it but they also leave out things because they want to listen as well. They're not like this is the way. They're like, >> \"Yeah, >> this is a way.\" And we're listening very carefully. And then they make iterations, which is great. >> Yeah. Speaking of which, this is a way that um if you are a if you want to build an AI, this is a way to think about doing it. Um we have a guide up on every um about agent native architectures. Um so this is if you're a developer, this is going to be really good for a developer. Uh it's also totally good if you're a non-developer. You just click read with claude or read with chatbt and it will tell you about what this is. But this basically boils down a lot of principles that we've kind of intuited from the way that Anthropic builds cloud code and now cloud for uh cloud co-work and turns it into a really easy guide to think about how do you build software in this era where agents are at the core of software instead of software being this sort of like deterministic thing that is is built with deterministic code that that are rules that are laid out beforehand by a programmer. Um instead um uh the core of something like pod code or quad co-work is just an agent and features are really just prompts to that agent to get work done and that opens up a whole new new territory of software to build and it opens up who gets to build software. So, if you're a non-technical person and you you're feeling like, \"Oh, I I can't really build software.\" I promise you, you can um you should really try um cloud code, you should really try just a cloud app or now it's worth trying um cloud co-work. I think that that it could be really good for vibe coding stuff. And if you're thinking about how to structure your apps, it's actually kind of not intuitive because it's a whole new world for for the way that you do programming. And so a lot of the a lot of programmer intuition I think is outdated and a lot of um therefore a lot of AI intuition about how to build software is outdated. So you need guides like these to help push your AI to do the right thing and build the build the thing in the right way. Um I think we're we're getting close to time. I'm going to need to hop off. We're both going to need to hop off and get some actual work done. Um this is fantastic. It was so fun. We're we do vibe checks for every new thing that come out. Uh we're doing this these live streams as a new thing. Usually we just write them, but uh you should expect next time there's a new model drop or a new product release that we will have a live stream vibe check with our internal testing. Remember, we get all this stuff before it comes out and we'll tell you what we like and what we don't like. Uh Kieran, any final words before we head off the stream? >> No. Cheers.
