  and better state management for AI development.


  Claude MCP as code revolutionizes how we handle tool calls by preventing
  context window bloat. This approach leverages Claude Code's capabilities to
  transform MCPs into efficient backend APIs. Discover how Claude Skills
  combined with MCP as code enables progressive disclosure, smarter workflows,
  and better state management for AI development.


  In this video, I break down Anthropic's paper on solving MCP context window
  problems. You'll learn why traditional MCPs consume 10%+ of your context
  before you even start working, and how converting them to code fixes this
  issue. I cover progressive disclosure for loading only what you need,
  context-efficient tool results that prevent data bloat, powerful control flow
  that reduces hallucinations, privacy-preserving operations for sensitive data,
  and state persistence using Claude's filesystem-based approach.


  Whether you're building with Claude or just curious about optimizing AI
  workflows, this video shows you practical solutions that software engineers
  have used for years—now applied to AI agents. Perfect for developers working
  with Model Context Protocol and anyone looking to maximize their AI agent's
  efficiency.
