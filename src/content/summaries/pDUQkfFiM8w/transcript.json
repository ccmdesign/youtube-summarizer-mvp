  "fullText": "If you run Google LSA ads, speed is everything. If you're not responding within five minutes, you're going to be losing all on a lot of leads, which is a lot of money. Today, I'm going to show you my set and forget automation I use to respond to every LSA lead, even while I'm sleeping. Let's get to it. All right, guys. So, the automation platform we're going to be using today is called Make.com. I'm sure many of you guys have already heard of it. Um, I was actually using Zap here before this, but I noticed that Make is able to do this for much cheaper and it's able to do everything that I need. So, uh, it's just a no-brainer. With that being said, I'll drop a referral link for you guys. Um, I'm actually using a free profile here myself. So, it's pretty dope that they allow you to do this straight off the bat. So, we're going to go ahead to create scenario. And you want to look for Gmail. You can type it in or it's right there for me. Um, and you want to look for the one that says watch emails, right? Going to select that. And essentially what's happening here is each time you get a new message from a new client, right? Or a new request from a new client, you get a email as well, right? Although you get a SMS message as well, you also get an email in the back end. And what we're going to be doing is using that email as a trigger for this automation. Um, now make sure that you're very specific, right? There's two filters that we want to set here to make sure everything works like it's supposed to. So for filter type, keep that as a simple filter. Make sure it's set for inbox, right? So the folder you want is inbox and skip all this. And you're going to hit advanced settings. And the first filter is going to be senders email, right? And Gmail, I mean uh LSA has a certain uh domain they use, which is going to be this at awe uh AW express, right? Make sure you do not forget this star. Do not forget the star. If you don't put the star in, it's just not going to work. Um because it needs to be dynamic. Now, the subject, um you could skip that has words. You actually want to make sure it has these specific words. And once again, just like the first filter, right? Make sure it's just like this. You don't want no changes. Sent you new requests. Um because like I said earlier, there's certain words that are in those emails from new clients and it's not an email the replies nor follow-up messages. From there, you can keep everything else the same. Um you know, the limits I haven't really played around with that quite yet, but I think 10 should be enough uh for what we're doing here. So, just go ahead and hit save. Now, what I would do if I were you, because you don't want to send some messages all the way to the old people and you don't want it backtracking, wasting credits, all that stuff. So, I would hit firm. Now, on to hit save there. And now, we're going to go on to the next step. Right. Now, this is this video is for two people. Um, if you want to be simple, right, and you don't want any AI to help you out with these uh responses, then you can go ahead and skip step two. So once again, skip step two if you don't want any AI assistance. But if you don't have no problem going through a few extra steps, then follow along with me. So step two, if we are going the AI route, which I do, you're going to look for OpenAI, which is this one, where you can type it once again, and you're going to look for the one um you're going to click it first, and you're going to look for generate completion, right? Nothing else but generate a completion, right? You're gonna hit that and then what you want to do is you want to connect your uh chat your open API. So you can go and add one and kind of walk you through how to do that. So in your open API says in the building page you can follow this link and I actually already have it open here. So we'll go over here and I'll create a new secret key. Right. We'll call it um NSA 3.0. Right. the project, default project, create the secret key. Make sure you save the secret key. This is super important for you to save that. Um, that way you don't lose it later on or something like that, right? And then we're going to go back over here. We're going to go back and you're going to just type that in. So, you have your API key and bam, right there. You can skip organization ID and hit save. Awesome. So, it went through. Now, what you want to do is you want to select your method. Um I I I I select this first option. I don't know about the legacy options. Now, the model, this is pretty important. There's a few mod few models and obviously um if you have premium, you'll have access to better models. Um, and then obviously for this you do have to have API and um the API keys and all that stuff that I you can you can search up for more videos to give you more information on that. Uh, it's nothing too crazy and it's pretty cheap as well. So, make sure you're going to uh select the right model, right? It has to say chat in it. Once again, if it does not say chat in it, it's not going to work like it's supposed to. The one I'm going to go with the latest one, chat GPT 5.2 chat. So, let's select that. Right? And this is where you need to pay some even closer attention. So, you're going to add a message, right? You want the role to be set as user and text content. This is going to be your prompt, right? And it's going to have a little more information than just a prompt in here. So, I actually have this on other sheet. I'mma copy. Bear with me. And I can provide you guys this template as well. So, don't worry. Now, this is the prompting. Now, there's a few things that are going to be unique. So, obviously, this is unique because this is my company's name, right? And then what my company does as well. So, obviously, if you're um a painting company, maybe you're called uh Paint Bros, right? Paint Bros, a residential and commercial painting company, right? Obviously, it's going to change for each company and their respective service. Um, make sure you scroll down and this is where it gets really important. Um, this is going to be the dynamic information. Uh, that way everything's filled in on its own accord, right? So, you want to first make sure that the customer's first name is there. Um, now it's not always going to be there, but if it is, then you want it to use that name. So, you're going to hit subject, right? And then for text context, it's pretty easy. You're going to go to full text body, right? Bam. And what this pretty much does is, like I said, it looks through the subject to see if there's a name because sometimes you will actually have a name pre-filled out in the subject line. And then this looks at the body. It reads the message. It reads the message and what the client had sent you. That way it could start responding. Um, after that, just scroll down, make sure everything's looking good. Um, I have my own things. Make sure you fill out all the, you know, unique information which on the template I'll obviously have it uh distinguished for you. But yeah, from there we can hit save once again and then we can go ahead and move on to the next step. So hit the plus sign, right? And this one's going to be a delay. A delay is very important because you don't want them to be sus. You don't want to look like a robot, but you still want to reply super quick. that way they don't start calling someone else. So, you're going to type in tools and then you're going to look for the one called sleep, which is a delay, like I said, and then I would go ahead and set it to about 180 seconds, which is roughly 3 minutes or exactly 3 minutes. Going to hit save. And then let's move on to the last step. Right, the last step is actually going to be Gmail again. So, hit Gmail and this time it's going to be send a new email or send an email. Now, you're going to connect to your account. Add account, connect to it. Pretty easy. I don't have to walk you through that. Now, for the two, you're going to add a recipient. The two here is going to be uh the from email. So, you're going to scroll down from email and you're going to look for the one that says from email. Bam. And then where you want the subject to be is the subject. Pretty easy right now. Um another thing here is this is really dependent on what you selected for the body type. Right? So, if you had selected a um if you have selected the Chad GBT version, which most of you probably did, then you're going to want to hit raw HTML. From here, we're going to go over to body type. Now, remember, there's two options. If the you went with the AI version, meaning you had chat GPT handle your reprise, then you want to actually select raw HTML. And then inside the contents, you're going to go over to result. And this is just going to pretty much uh make the reply the output that chat G chat GPT ended up generating. Now, if you ended up just wanting to go with the more simple version of this where it's just a static um reply, right? Just to keep on top of everything, nothing too crazy. Then you're actually going to want to hit this one right here, collection of contents. And then you're going to go over here to add body contents and then text. And you then you can add something like this like thanks for reaching out. We received the request and uh we'll be with you shortly. Oops. That little space right there. But yeah. Um and then from there you can actually just go and save, right? And then you're pretty much done. Um, now what I recommend doing here, uh, if you want to test this, right, is actually duplicating. So before I do that, I'm going to come here and just change that one thing because I actually do want mine to be the uh, AI type of reply, right? And then I'm going to hit results, like I said, and then save. From here, what we want to do is we want to go and save. So, make sure you save a name. I want name this one LSA auto reply. Um, and then going to hit the save button. Now, if you want to test this, this is the way I would do it. First, head back to your scenarios. Click scenarios. Go over to the one you just made. In this case, it's going to be this one. And clone it. I'll hit I would hit yes. And then we'll call this copy. Now, the first thing you want to do here is click on Gmail and we actually want to scroll down and we want to take out the filter we had made earlier for the uh AW Express. That way we could test it out with our own personal email, right? Then scroll down and save. And then also, of course, make sure that the prompt's looking good. Namely, making sure these little bracket thingies are out. I just had that for you guys to see. Of course, make sure the logic there's at good at the bottom. Other than that, looks looking cool. Save. Now, even more important before you guys run it is I want you to go back to this and I want you to right click it and I want you to go to choose where to start. You're going to go and click from now on again and you're going to save. Then you're going to press save once again. And now I'm going to show you that example email. So I had an email that I made that looks just like what you would uh see in real life. So here it is. Has all the information, has a name, and has the message. So I'm going to go ahead and send that. And then we're going to give it a few seconds to carry over. with me. Cool. So, now that I'm sure that it sends over, I'm going to go ahead and hit run once. Now, you should see it start populating and start running through the automations. You can click here and make sure it's the right person, Felix Gomez. You can see the uh result that it came up with which is actually really good and then of course the delay here. Cool. And now it sends off. And now let's go back to the inbox to see if I got a reply. Let's click that. Awesome. Here we go. Now, what that's going to do is it's going to make sure that you stay ranked at the top in Google LSA and Google My Business, which then in turn is going to result in you getting more clients. Google My Business and LSA, they're very uh reactive, right? They like to see that people are active on their platforms and they reward that. Um so making sure that you're really quick to reply but also you know making sure that you're moving the conversation forward and two um at the same time is super important. So hopefully uh that made sense to you. But other than that this is just a test one. So after you're done verifying that it works then you can go ahead and um pretty much run the real one. Now remember, if you are testing out a another email that say you want to test it out more than once, what I noticed from my expertise is um if you don't go sorry if you don't Oh, that's that. If you don't right click it and go to choose where to start from now again and save that and then save that and then you send like an email, then it will work. But if you don't do that, then it's not going to work. So other than that, uh appreciate you guys for watching. A few tips before you guys start implementing these automations. Be super super wary of not changing the keyword in step one or else it's not going to work like it's supposed to. And secondly, make sure you're paying attention to all your data, right? Um clicking the wrong thread, anything like that when it comes to Zapier and these type of automations is just going to render the whole automation useless. Um with that being said, if you guys have any more questions, need any more help at all, let me know. Or if you just want the automation template for yourselves, I'll actually have it for free to get to you guys. just DM me on IG, which is going to be in the link in the description, and uh I'll give you guys that for",
