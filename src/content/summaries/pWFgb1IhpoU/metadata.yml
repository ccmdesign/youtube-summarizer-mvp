description: >-
  AI search is changing faster than most marketers realize.


  ChatGPT is evolving from a simple Q&A tool into a full discovery engine, and
  in 2026, the algorithm is getting its biggest shift yet.


  In this video, I break down the 8 major SEO updates that I believe ChatGPT
  will make that will change how brands get ranked, cited, and recommended
  inside ChatGPT.


  If you run a business, create content, or rely on AI for visibility… you need
  to understand these shifts before they happen.


  What You’ll Learn 


  - How ChatGPT is changing the way it decides which brands to cite and
  recommend

  - Why certain sources (and platforms) will lose authority while others gain
  power

  - How video, sentiment, and freshness signals will reshape AI discovery

  - What brands must start doing now to stay visible in 2026 and beyond
