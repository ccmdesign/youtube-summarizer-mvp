  "fullText": "Hello. Hope you are doing well. So yeah, this is week two. If you watched the last episode, you know we are doing a bit of a different thing this year. We're just going to build out all these AI micro businesses from everything we learned the last 3 years. And we're going to track everything and I'm going to share a bit here what I'm doing each week. So uh in week two or I guess this video, it's just going to be me showing you what we earn in revenue so far in 26. Uh I have like a crazy viral AI video at the moment uh from yesterday. Hey, I just wanted to show you how that could work if you find the right thing. Uh, we're going to build an email agent because I need that for next week using Cloud Code. I think that's going to be helpful. Uh, I'm going to take a look at Claude. I wrote code work. I made Claude co-work just a quick look at it since I have the max plan. Anyway, and I have like a quick AI video workflow from my course I wanted to just preview. If you're interested in this, this might trigger something you want to try out yourself. And just talk a bit about my other plans. I have something about the Quen new embeddings model I've been looking at. I have some ideas around that. So yeah, hopefully this could be interesting and we can give you some inspiration. So yeah, let's just get going. So uh we're going to start with the revenue so far this uh month or January. So I think it's been pretty good, I guess. So this is not my YouTube channel or other businesses. This is kind of only kind of the side hustle thing with the AI micro businesses, right, that I've been talking about. So, so far we have $467 in January. And the reason I'm bringing in kind of the AI video course here is because that's fully built with cloud code. Everything is AI generated. I haven't that's a micro business, right? Uh I guess I do the courses, but everything is generated by AI. I haven't bought anything. I built the platform from scratch using cloud code. So, we brought in $210 uh from the course platform this month so far. Uh pretty happy with that. Uh I think it's good value. So yeah, uh I have a bit more on that later. And the shorts channels that kind of come over from last year. Uh that is not the new channels we built lately. Uh but if you look at kind of those individual, you can see I just screenshotted kind of the January number so far. And you can see one has 920. This is a bit of a dying channel, but $46 in revenue there. 2.4 million. This is a good one. 121 and $1.892. So all of these are quite good. They're quite easy to make using AI. Uh but uh those kind of amount up to 257. So uh I built this tool to kind of track this, right? And we can kind of keep track of monthly growth and stuff. So that's pretty nice. So this is where we are so far this year in January. And I think it's going to end up around 600 or something or maybe a bit more. We'll see. So yeah, that is basically what we have so far and I'm pretty happy with that. There are room to grow here, I think. So that's basically what we're going to try and I'm going to try to share a bit what I'm actually doing here. So I guess I could start like by showing you a number seems very strange like how do you earn so much money on shorts? But if you go to uh one of the this channel I I created last night, right? And look at these numbers here. So, in like 15 hours or something, 493,000 views and the last 60 minutes, it's 72,000 views. So, don't come say that these videos don't produce a lot of views and you get short ads for stuff like that. So, these are just crazy numbers. This is by far my most viral video ever. And you can see this is even growing now. You can see we have this upward trend here. And this probably is going to get millions of views this video if something doesn't happen, I guess. And this is a new channel, so I got like 1,500 subs in one day. That's pretty crazy. That that's kind of out of the normal scope. And you can see here, this is the only video we have here on this channel. Uh, but you can see this is something you can do. Um, and it's working, right? So, a lot of people kind of ask me how do you do this? Uh I have explained a bit about this in my my uh course. So we're going to do a quick preview of that later I think. But uh just to show you that it this works uh and it's still working. So if you are into this this is a great AI micro business you can get into. But now uh I think we're just going to build a tool because I think I need like an a email agent next week and I haven't decided yet if I'm going to use MCP. I think we're just going to use MCP. It's pretty easy. Uh, we could use skills too. Uh, yeah, maybe. Yeah, we can use MCP. I think it's fine. So, let's just head to cloth. I created like a directory here. EML agent. Okay. So, we're going to use clo code for this. Uh, let's go to cursor and we have the re uh not a repo but kind of the yeah, our ID here. So, it's empty now. Uh but I just want to say to Claude that uh what the plan is uh what we are going to do. So we're just going to build like a simple Gmail agent. So we need a Google GCP account here or console. And I'm kind of going to walk you through how I do it because it's pretty easy to set up. So I think we want to gather some documentation first. Before we do that, I think we need kind of the cloud code uh documentation for MCP at least. So I'm just going to head over to Antropic. Here you can see connect code cloud tools via MCP. So I'm just going to copy this uh and let's just create a docs here and let's just call it something like um CC uh MCP uh MD and just paste in that. Okay, so now we have that and I think kind of cloud code already knows how to set up like an email agent with MCP uh because basically all we need is to be kind of logged into our yeah Google Cloud account here and we need some oat and stuff like that to actually get into the email but that is not so hard to set up and I'm going to kind of walk you through how you do it if you want to copy this email agent Gmail agent. Okay. So, I'm just going to dictate to Cloud Code here what we're going to do and should be pretty straightforward from there. Okay. So, uh we're going to build like a simple email agent and we're going to use MCP for this. Uh I have all the documentation you need uh for actually implementing the MCP in uh I'm just going to tag the docs here, right? Uh and the CCMP. Okay. So what I want you to do is uh this is going to be Gmail. Uh we have our console already on GCP. So basically you just need to set up everything we need uh to actually connect to our Gmail account via the MCP server. And you can also create like a step-by-step guide we should follow to actually get into the console on GCP to every find everything we need. And you can just ask for more information if you need it. So let's just start working on this MCP for our Gmail. So we can send emails, we can read emails, we can write emails and everything around email on Gmail, right? So yeah, let's just build out a plan for this and let's get started. So yeah, maybe not the best instructions, but let's see here. So I'm going to switch to plan mode and I'm going to let Claude code come up with a plan here. Okay, so you can see Claude has a plan for us. Now I'm just going to quickly uh look over this. So um yeah, we need all this list, read, send, reply, search. Okay, that looks pretty good. Okay. Yeah, we need a credential paths. We're going to download this from GCP. And yeah, I think everything here looks fine for the plan. Credentials, we need a token. And yeah, let's try it. and see how this works. And hopefully this shouldn't be too much of a hassle, but we just need kind of the instruction from Claude here how uh you can do this on GCP here afterwards. Okay, so that looks pretty great. So now I just want to show you if you want to do this yourself, how we can kind of use this. So you will need a Google console cloud account, right? And from there you're just going to select create a new project if you don't have anyone. Next step is going to be just to enable the Gmail API. That's super easy. I guess I could show you. So, you just go to API and services and you file enabled APIs and services and then you just enable kind of the the Gmail API. Click on it and enables. That's super easy. Okay. So, the next step now is kind of configuring the all out consent screen. So, basically how I use this is I go from API and services. I click on kind of consent screen here and I just go down to you can for example go down to clients right and just click on CL create client but before that uh I want to do something down here I think or is it data access uh because we need some scopes and what we need is these Gmail scopes right and you can see I have kind of added this so you can see I have Gmail scope scopes the Gmail modify read only and I have the send scope right so that is something you need to add here and it's basically just add and remove scopes so it's pretty easy and when we have done that we can go to clients and we can create a new client if you wanted to so you can see down here create credentials uh I I guess we can do it that way so we can go back to API and services now we go on credentials and create credentials and who client ID, right? And if you check here, you can see we need to select the desktop app and we can name it Gmail MCP server for example. So just go here and we do desktop app and we can name it Gmail MCP server and we're just going to create this. So I probably have to blur this one. But here you can kind of download your secret or your JSON and your ID and secret and stuff, right? And you can see that the credentials.json file I downloaded. We're going to put this in our email agent folder. So I'm just going to go and do that. Okay. So if we go here now, you can see I have my credentials.json file here. Perfect. Okay. So the final thing we have to do now is just uh authenticate this uh to get the token. So I'm just going to run this pseudo here. Uh I'm going to use this in here. Okay. Uh good. And you can see we get this link here. And then we're just going to open up this authentication successful. Perfect. And if we go back now, hopefully we kind of have uh our token here. Yes, that's good. You can now use the email server. So, I'm just going to stop this and I say great. Now, let's add the MCP server. Uh we have the at token, right? So, we needed the token JSON before we can add the server. And that hopefully should be it. And we can try it out. Yes, I want to add that. Okay. So, I'm going to restart now. So, I'm going to exit clear and I'm just going to resume and then we're going to try it. So, resume. Uh let's test read or just fetch uh latest email. Let's see if you're going to use the server. Okay, list five. Okay, let's see. Perfect. Okay, the Gmail server is working. You can see we have saw the last five emails we got here. Perfect. So now we can try it out. I want to try it out by sending an email to myself. So to test this now, I'm just going to try to send an email to my email address and with a greeting from you, the email agent. So let's just see. I'm going to bring up my phone here and I'm going to see if I get the email. So yeah, you can see we fill out the body. It says true. So let me see if I get this on my Yeah, we got it. I don't know if you can see this, but you can see this is working. So now we kind of have our Gmail agent set up and yeah, I need that for next week because I have some ideas how I want to use this. Uh but that's going to be in the next video. But now our tool is ready and I'm ready to use this next week for a pretty interesting thing I think. So yeah, pretty easy to set up this with Claude code. And if you have some knowledge about GCP and you have a Gmail, it's not very hard. And this is something you don't really have to pay for because now Claude uh can read your emails. It can delete emails, but you got to be a bit careful, right? And I only use this locally. This is not like a remote server or anything. So, it's just locally hosted MCP server for my Gmail. So, yeah, perfect. We have that for next week. So, now uh I wanted to take a bit of a look at Claude Kovberg since I have the max plan. Let's just take a quick look at it. I'm not going to spend much time, but uh I haven't tried it yet. So, I just downloaded this app here. Yeah, there there was some fuss about cloud co work. That's hard for my tongue to say instead of cloud code, but cloud co-work this week. Uh I haven't tried it because someone said it's basically cloud code but in an interface. So, I don't really know. I know we set up like a workspace we can have our files and stuff in. Uh so, I need to think of something we can try with this. Uh, I think I'm going to grab a data set and let's try to do something with that. Okay, so I went over to Kaggle here and I saw this VP fitness data set. So, let's try to download this this data set. So, it's 100,000 days of recovery, sleep, and HRV workout for 286 athletes. Okay, so let's just date download this in a zip file, I guess. Okay, so we have our data set here and what should we ask this? Ask uh Claude cowork here now. Uh I'm going to come up with something. So let's try this. So based on the data, create a simple short presentation about three keys fi key findings. I need this in 15 minutes to present on stage. Use artifacts for the presentation slides max five slides. So I have no idea what's going to happen now, but hopefully we can use this data set to create some kind of presentation and it's I think it's kind of the underlying thing is that it's can use files and stuff because when I started this it created like a workspace and now it uh hopefully it's going to use artifacts too and we have the context. So I think I'm just going to let this run for a bit and I'm going to take you back if there's something interesting here. Okay, so you can see now we kind of have this progress bar on the top here. So we have analyzed the data set. Uh I found three compelling insights based on the 100,000 records. Did it go through all that? I don't know. So let me create your presentation slides now. And now it's starting to do our JSX files here. That's going to be our presentation. And yeah, let's see uh maybe we get some good insights from the W fitness data set here. Okay. Yeah, that looks pretty good. Can we do it in like uh like a bigger format here? Or we can do it like this. So, whoop fitness data key insights from 100,000 records. So, if you go to the next hit delivers 5x more strain than yoga. Okay, that was one finding. So, this hit high intensity training is more efficient or more strain than yoga. Okay, not a big insight there, but okay. Older users have better recovery scores. Okay. Uh, okay. I don't know why, but that's fine. Nearly half of users achieve high recovery. This is not a full slide, is it? It's fine. Doesn't really matter too much. Only 2.8% of record slow recovery. Okay. TK key takeaways. Activity type matters age. Okay, not the best insights, but it did work I guess. So that was pretty interesting. And we can see this in code if we wanted to. And yeah, pretty smooth. Uh but we also could have done this in cloud code, I guess. So uh there are some connectors here. Let's check them out. So see all connectors. So, we can connect to Gmail. Should we try to connect to our Gmail just to see if it works? Let's find the latest sent email. So, that should be uh the email we sent to me about the the agent, right? Okay. So, we need to install in extension and stuff. Yeah, I think I'm just going to drop that. I don't really care. So, yeah, I'm just going to disconnect that. Uh, I think our um MCP agents is fine enough for this. Uh, but yeah, I I think this is fine. I don't really know what else to try here. Uh, yeah, I don't have any great ideas, but if I come up with something for the next week, uh, we can maybe take a look at it. Uh, but I guess it's fine. Like, if you don't want to be in like a terminal like cloud code, uh, I guess this is fine. So I'm not going to spend any more time on this now. Yeah, interesting idea I guess from Claude from Antropic. So yeah, I'm just going to leave co-worker here and I wanted to play you like um so this is my the AI videocourse.com. This is kind of my course platform where I I haven't updated it in a while now uh because uh I haven't really done anything new, but I have an idea now. I've been playing around with and this is kind of the latest success of the video we just watched earlier. So I might do update on the course over the weekend. We'll see or at least next week. So that's going to be a new module. Uh but I wanted to play you uh just like a short part of this module because this is what I've been using uh for December for automating this interesting this videos. So I thought I can play like a minute so you kind of get an idea how this works or zero two three right or one to four. So the flow is we do a user input for celebrities plus the location we grab the source image. So this is me kind of in my course explaining kind of the the pipeline for the automation part of this setup. We create a selfie. We create a video with the source image and the transition over to the selfie. We extract the last frame from the first selfie, right? Or from this video. We create a new selfie. We create a new transition video with the last frame to the new selfie. Yeah. So, that is kind of a preview of um the course and kind of how I'm using um using um automation to set up this video pipelines. So I of course I go much more into detail in the course module here. Uh but yeah if you're interested you can have a look at it. I even go through some of the code here I use. So yeah I thought I'd just play you like a quick preview because I get a lot of questions of um where you can find where I actually share these kind of ideas I have. So of course it's a bit of a promotion of my platform too. So yeah go check it out. I'm going to leave a link in the description the aivididecourse.com. super easy to get into and it's just a onetime pay and you get all the upcoming uh modules as well as you saw earlier in this video. It's very valuable if you want to get into this AI micro businesses. So the final topic of the day may not be for everyone but this is something I'm going to look at this weekend and it's the new um quen 3VL embeddings model and there's a new reanker too. So this is basically we can use this uh it's multimodal so we can embed images, screenshots, video, everything uh and get it into like a vector database. So I want to build something with this I think over the weekend. I haven't 100% decided yet how I'm going to do it, but I think I'm going to start at look at it at least. So you can see here if you kind of zoom in uh it's pretty straightforward. We can put in text, image, visual documents, video, everything and embedded into like this uh multimodel representations page. Then we can search on this, right? So that could be very powerful if we want to create like an automated way of editing videos. So we can have like a database with a bunch of different clips uh our AI agent can use in generating media, right? So this could be bringing up videos, video clips that kind of fit fits our voiceover script or something like that. So, I'm going to look at this model over the weekend and actually see if we can set up some kind of database with um yeah, how can you call it? a Eclipse database and um if we can use some agents to actually call upon uh that search that database and find where the clips are stored and we can just fetch those clips and use them in like an automated way to yeah create some kind of video model agent or it could be images or it could be text or anything. So I think I'm going to look at this over the weekend just to check it out because I think it think it could be pretty interesting. So yeah, I think that's going to be it for today. So let's see. Uh did we cover everything? We covered the revenue, the insane viral video, we built the email agent, we had a quick look at cloud code work or co-work uh the workflow preview and some other plans I have. Uh I have a bunch of other plans too, but I'm I don't think I'm need to talk about them now. Uh but just to sum this up, so you might have some questions. Why am I spending so much time on like video and stuff like that? Shouldn't I be just building some kind of products? So, in the last video, uh I talked about kind of my NPC um my NPC creative uh agents platform C where I do AI video agents. I have been working on that too a bit uh but I think I'm going to look at it a bit more next week. But the reason I'm using video and stuff like that is because of marketing, right? because you need if you're going to build these simple small AI micro businesses, you need some way to get this out to people and it's pretty valuable to be able to reach a lot of people like we are doing like in this video and this can be used in the future for marketing for a new product or something you are creating. So that is why I spend so much time on this and why I'm looking into this VL embeddings and stuff like that because the attention economy, right? So yeah, that was it for today and yeah, hope you enjoyed it and I guess we can do one more thing before we end. So if I go to this is kind of the new short channels uh I did. So uh I wanted to sync this just to see how many views we have on all the new channels we have created. So, we are up to 1.7 million and that is not counting the latest channel here. I see. Yeah, I might have to fix that. But we are 1.7 million 10 shorts. That's pretty good. And with the new channel we created yesterday, I guess we are over 2 million. So, that's pretty good, too. So, yeah, that was it for this episode. Hopefully, we have some more interesting stuff maybe next week. But yeah, that was it. and I wish you a good weekend, a good week, and I'll see you again maybe next Friday. I have some other videos coming up next week, but that's a different topic. So, yeah, have a nice weekend, and I'll see you soon.",
