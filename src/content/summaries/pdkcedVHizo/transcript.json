  "fullText": "Rick, in outlining kind of how the White House, how the Trump administration sees this hopefully hopefully playing out um with a move towards uh elections in some short order. Talk to me if you could about those uh influences that exist in Venezuela that may not want to see that happen. And and maybe we could start first with your assessment of of uh China, Russia, Iran, Cuba. How do we deal with those elements because they've been fairly well entrenched ever since Hugo Shabas's days? >> Correct. Yeah. Yeah. And that is really one of the the biggest threats that we had here in our hemisphere to our our own national security. So this wasn't so much that Maduro tolerated or or you know or worked with uh say Hamas or Hezbollah. Um he he rolled out the red carpet. I mean, uh, going dating back to as early as the late 90s, uh, this is under Chavez and and continued, right? Um, they had no problem issuing Venezuelan passports to to Iranian terrorists, you know, and and giving them docks that then they could use to come here. Of course, now over the years, the the strength of a Venezuelan passport probably, you know, doesn't get you much, but but, you know, that that gets you the right mindset. there's been a lot of now in the open sources kind of reporting which I do encourage people to read um that as early you know Maduro would fund and and and invite and interact with a lot of a lot of the the farleft fanatical groups here in our own country um and and he would provide them with uh access and training and support um which then spills into our own streets back here. So, uh, when it comes to to, um, uh, to China and Russia on on the Russian side, I mean, can you imagine uh, Mike, if I would have told you 10 years ago that we would have had spatnots running around in our hemisphere, right? You know, you you would have said I was on drugs, right? You would have said you're crazy. But that's exactly what we were at that what was going on. You know, um, they were setting up communication equipment and satellites and and arm sales uh, uh, with the Venezuelans. They were using this as as a launching pad, but as well it became that like an aircraft carrier in our own hemisphere where the Chinese, the Russians and others could then export their chaos to other places. And they did that. I suspect now with Maduro in custody and as his uh his friendship with the DOJ will will grow. uh he'll he'll be providing probably some really good information as to the the you know the organizations and individuals he's provided money to not just in Latin America but perhaps even here in the United States. Um uh >> it will be interesting to see what degree I'm sorry for interrupting you Rick. It will be really interesting to see to what degree he's willing to and we may not see it but to what degree he's willing to cooperate um with the uh with the authorities. I I I remember the they used to say the same thing about El Chapo, remember? You know, from from the cartel in Mexico and then he started singing like a bird. >> So, um you know, and and this may be the case with him or or or with his wife. Um the the the Russians were really uh focused on on the military. You know, they had they the Russians, Think about this. Um we had Russian destroyers helping Maduro patrol the Caribbean on Carter narcotics operations. I I mean it's just it's insane, right? It's insane. Uh I mean, think about that, right? Uh uh so so so the Chinese obviously with with all the debt that the that the Venezuelans owed the Chinese he take all the oil out and and give it to the Chinese uh give it to the that's how he paid his bills was with oil. >> Um and then and then half of that oil that they'd pump out of course they'd sell on the black market for themselves and then the other half they they'd give it to uh to our adversaries. So this was a from head to toe a complete criminal enterprise >> uh at the top of it. >> Uh you talked about uh the counter narcotics uh angle and of course this whole thing the the early stages of the deployment out there military deployment by the US. Uh it was all pegged towards counter narcotics operations right obviously and then we were targeting these various uh boats coming out and and uh that that made the headlines repeatedly. uh if you could can you talk about this uh the cartel de la souls because there's there's some confusion I think out there right some people talk about it as if it is a it's like the the loettas or it's a siloa cartel it's it's a you know very organized structure other people talk about it and say uh no it's sort of a loose uh arrangement an affiliation uh aided and embedded by you know all the people within the top of the Venezuelan regime. Other people say, I've had conversations with people who said, \"Oh, no, no, the cartel loss, that's a that's a a madeup thing by the CIA to justify our actions in Venezuela.\" >> Yeah. Yeah. So, so, um, you Well, I can tell you it's not a madeup thing. It is as real as it gets. Um if if you if you look at Venezuela right along its Colombian border uh and and most of u you know if you draw a line right down the middle of Venezuela from north to south everything left everything west of that is just Amazon jungle right there's nothing you know it's just thick deep jungle it's f it's places where where where you know um regular services and law enforcement that it just doesn't exist out there these are small tribes some of them don't even speak Spanish they speak indigenous language ages. Uh, you know, uh, this this is like real Amazon area. What started to happen, um, in in like the early 2000s when when Colombia started to get really really tough on FARC and ELN and and and other other terrorists that they had that they were dealing with, those folks that started moving across the border into Venezuela where they felt pretty safe, right? They're across the border. Colombians can't really get to them there. and uh um you know under Chavez and Maduro, you know, they're going to leave us alone. What Maduro did was he he incorporated it into his defense strategy. He anticipated that if uh if anybody was ever going to go after them, they'd go after him through Colombia because Colombia up until a couple years ago was rather adversarial towards Venezuela and rightfully so. Right. So he when he saw that that all these FARC dissident and ELN and Sunda Marcatali and all these guys were were there uh you know on his land he basically made a deal with him and with them and it was it was simple right the generals in those areas said look you you continue to deal drugs right to package grow you know grow the drugs finish it you know finish drugs um um uh the paste and all that stuff would come through Colombia they process it in Venezuela uh you guys sell it. You, you know, you take it out of here. Um, you make sure to kick back some money to us, right? To the military system, to the generals, and then the generals have to then kick up. They've got, so this is like typical mafia, right? You know, you've got your earners, you've got your captains, you've got your your your foot soldiers. And that's exactly how they were running it. Except they were all wearing Venezuelan military uniforms. So that's where the cartel's solo names comes from. It's it's the the epilelettes on their uniforms has a little sun on it, right? So, so, so you know, if you were a high-ranking uh Venezuelan military officer and you had the the sun as an insignia on your on your applet, you know, you could join, you could be a member of this cartel, de los Solis. Celia and Nicolasito, Maduro's sons were the ones who who've been running and operating and managing that on the day-to-day all under the blessing of uh of Nicholas Maduro. So, so that that's what cartel the Los Solis is. It it it provides the protection, the the the reach, the and and lends the resources and capabilities to uh um to to terrorists, you know, that that are in the jungles and and doing what what they need. It's it's it's also shapeown. Anybody would go out there or want something, well, you got you got to you got to pay out. It's as corrupt as can be. >> Hey, thanks for tuning in.
