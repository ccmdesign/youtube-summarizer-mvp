title: How NVIDIA’s 8B Model Beat GPT-5 Using Reinforcement Learning
description: >-
  NVIDIA just changed the game for AI Agents. 🤯


  Their new paper, ToolOrchestra, proves you don't need a trillion-parameter
  model for every step of your workflow. By training a small 8B model with
  Reinforcement Learning (specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization), they
  beat GPT-5 on complex reasoning tasks while slashing costs by over 70%. 📉


  In this video, I break down the architecture that kills the "Monolith":

  🚫 The Bias Problem: Why simple prompt-based routers fail.

  🧠 The Orchestration Paradigm: How to treat GPT-5 as just another tool.

  🛠️ GRPO Explained: Training a model to care about your budget.

  🚀 The Blueprint: How to start building virtualized intelligence today.


  Stop burning money on massive models. It's time to orchestrate. 👇
