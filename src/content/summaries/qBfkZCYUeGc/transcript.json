  "fullText": "My name is Ali and in this video I'm going to show you how you can test and debug your AI agents as fast as possible. So here I have a very simple AI chatbot that is connected to my Instagram and probably if you have done this before you know that this is a very simple chatbot where we receive a message in the web hook and we have our AI agent to produce an answer and then we send it back to the user. So this is only a demo and very simple AI agent to show you how fast you can test and debug your AI agents with this new method. So I already have connected my Instagram to this AI agent. And this agent is ready to answer any questions. And now I'm going to show you two powerful things that you can use in order to test your AI agents. So the first thing is that the very new release from cloud and this is the extension that you can use in your browser. So cloud works in your browser. Basically you can add cloud as an extension to your browser and give them tasks and cloud can take over your browser and get the job done for you. So here you see now cloud can navigate, click buttons and fill forms in your browser. You can just give cloth some tasks, some daily tasks and it will take actions like book an appointment directly into your calendar. So now we're going to download Chrome extension and install it on our web browser. So as you can see I already have uh mine here. It is connected but if you don't have it then definitely you can search for cloud extension and search on Google. The first thing you see it's clouding chrome. This is their website. But the uh second one is exactly uh takes you to Chrome web store and from here you can download it. So right now I have it here is already installed. Now that was for cloud. So another method is to download comet browser which is for perplexity AI. So perplexity is a platform that lets you search and deep search on the internet based on desired topic and they have their own web browsers and its name is comet. So right now I'm using this comet uh browser instead of Chrome and you can just go to perplexity/ comt and download this web browser for you and then just sign in into your account and then once you download it from here you see you have a assistant tab so if you click on this assist assistant tab it will uh open this u page for you which exactly the same as uh cloud extension here you have an personal AI assistant that can uh take over of your browser so it can also take actions like clicking buttons scrolling link taking screenshots basically an AI assistant that you can give tasks and they will take care of. So we're going to use both of them in order to test our AI agent. But here's a trick. So right now I'm on my uh Instagram page and here is the account that I connected to my AI agent. So imagine that this is the uh account and the AI agent is connected to this one. And now I want to take actions instead of me coming here and type everything and every time send it by myself. I want to use COD uh extension and comet AI assistant to come here and talk to this AI agent and interact with it. So let me close this two. Uh we don't need this one. All we need is to open uh the tab that we want to give access and from here I just need to click on cloud and you see it uh immediately uh creates a group tab which is going to be under this cloud. So if you click it will disappear and appears. Yeah. So now this tab Instagram tab is under the cloud group and cloud can take actions on this page and from here I can choose my model oppus 4.5 which is the best one and it also consumes your credits so fast that's why I recommend you to put it on set 4.5. This is also good and again if I click on assistant on comment it will open this page again for me that now I can ask uh whatever I want. So now let's first use cloud in order to give u cloud some tasks and it can talk to our AI agent here. All right. But now I'm saying that I want you to talk to this person that uh this one that we have the message open and pretend yourself as someone who wants to learn AI and see what services he offers and then I'm saying that sending a hello start the conversation by sending a hello and wait for a response and move on uh and move on and keep talking to them and the message window is already open and let me just add something here and let's just send it. Yeah. So now cloud will take uh like read this and give us a plan that we need to read it. Yeah, this is the plan. Taking actions here and taking a screenshot. Send the initial message. Wait for wait and read Ali's response. Continue the conversation naturally. Maintain the persona of someone genuinely interested in learning. So this plan is good to me. But if you don't like anything, you can always make changes. But let's just create uh click on approve and cloud will now interact with our browser take a screenshots see what it is here. Uh click on buttons uh typing whatever it needs to be done. All right. Now it is clicking here to type its message and let's see what it writes here. All right. Great. Now it is typing and type the message and probably it will now take a screenshot again. Yeah, it did. And now it will click on this button. Let me show my hands. I'm not taking anything. The mouse is here. So cloud is working by itself and now it will press the uh yeah send button and send the message that is very good. So now it will wait uh to receive the answer. So yeah uh the agent answered and now cloud will take a screenshot and again ask questions and it goes on but I don't think it's going to stop ever. So uh it is u up to you uh you can just give task uh to stop at certain time but if you want to cloud stop at any time you can just click on stop cloud and that's it. So it is up to you. If you want cloud to stop at like certain uh point that reaches the conversation then you can just give it to this instruction. Let's say that for example you tell claude that keep talking to the person until you have this kind of answers and you think it's uh enough and then uh finish the conversation by uh stopping. So it will not continue the conversation anymore. Now it saw the uh full message because the message was also hidden. So it scrolled up took like a screenshot and now uh sending three message uh at at a time. All right. Yeah. But uh the agent is not able to uh answer all of them at once. So probably I have I should have uh told cloud that sending the message only as a single message not to just burst messaging uh the agent. But anyway yeah the agent is answering cloud will take a picture and uh send it back to them and keep talking. So from here you can see uh what are the answers and then you can just take actions like um making your AI agent better and better. So now let's stop cloud because now it goes and talk to uh the agent forever. I don't want it. And now I'm going to uh close cloud and I'm going to uh start using comet uh perplexity assistant and see what kind of actions it can take. So yeah, let's uh close from here and also we can ungroup it. All right. Now we have only our comment assistant here and I also need to remove these uh previous chats so we can start a fresh one. All right. Now I already deleted everything the previous chats and now uh to assistant for Perplexi comment. I'm saying that I want you to talk to this person. Pretend yourself as the same person. And I added this that I said wait for the response and move on with the conversation until you book appointment with him for tomorrow 12 p.m.. So this is only to show you that we can also stop talking to the person after we have what we want. So yeah, after booking appointment for tomorrow 12:00 p.m. this AI assistant should definitely stop talking. And I'm saying that do not send the multiple messages at once. Send only one message at a time. So let's just send it. And now Perplexity Comet or better say assistant is taking over the browser and it is working. Yeah, it is now clicking uh taking screenshots, typing hello, sending the message again. Taking back a screenshot, waiting for the answer to arrive. Yeah, we got the message back. Now it is waiting for 3 seconds again. Taking the screenshots, reading the page and typing back again. So yeah, and the good thing is that with assistant from comments, you can open the screenshots and see what are the screenshots. But with cloud, I couldn't find a way to open them like this. So this is another advantage. All right, it says, \"Hi, thank you for quick response. I really interested in learning AI.\" And yeah, I think one next week session would work. So yeah, the AI agent is answering and our AI assistant is also doing a great job at testing and the messages. So yeah, it says, \"Thanks. Uh, sounds perfect. I prefer 90 minute session to make the most of each week.\" And now it is saying with uh tomorrow at 12 p.m. works for the first session. The agent is confirming the tomorrow uh meeting. And yeah, the assistant is also sending a message. Perfect. Yes, I confirm 12:00 p.m. My name is Alex Johnson for example for the payment. I prefer PayPal. You can send the details at this email address. Thanks. So the agent is saying confirmed. Next step is this. This one quick question. Do you want to pay per session or full week plan up front? All right, let's see till when they will talk to each other. Great. Thanks for confirming. I'll prefer to pay session for now. Looking forward to our first session tomorrow. Perfect. So now it confirmed. If anything changes last minute, what's the best backup contact for you? So now probably it should give a simple like random phone number. Oh, it says Instagram DM works fine as backup. Contact me here. Thanks again. Okay, now it is confirming saying that I will send you an email. So let's see when this conversation ends. Probably never going to end because they will uh say thank you to each other and keep u talking. But the AI assistant from Comet should finally finish. Yeah, it did. Perfect. So I successfully completed the task. Here is the summary of what happened. And it also gives you a summary so you can understand instead of reading every message you can understand what happened. And the last message again was from the agent because if you talk to the agent uh again and again it will send you answer like without stopping. But this is very good that we told comet to stop the messaging once you reach at certain level. And what it surprises me is that it says my Instagram handle is this. So this is exactly my Instagram handle that I'm talking to this uh person. So I don't know from where it took this maybe from somewhere here but yeah it it did a great job. I think it did a great job even better than cloud but I'm not sure because I need to test cloud few more times because maybe uh my prompt was not good enough for cloud to take these kind of actions but perplexity did a very great job probably I'm going to test cloud again but feel free for yourself to download the extensions and also download comment uh browser and just test uh your AI agent this way. So this way is much way faster and you can scale your AI agent. Now this was only an example. So imagine that based on uh type of AI agent that you have. You can just create personas and give these personas to comment and also to cloud and just tell them that pretend that you are this person and go talk to my AI agent and test the answers. Then you can gather all of the answers, read them and make a file and then just give it to another AI and say that hey this is the answer make it better and from there you can work on your AI agent with a good insight and analysis. So if you want to get cloud extension and also comment browser definitely check out the description. I'm going to put all the links in the description for you so you can just click and download them.
