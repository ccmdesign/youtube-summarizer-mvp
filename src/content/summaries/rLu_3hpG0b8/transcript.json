  "fullText": "At this point, I've made multiple videos on frameworks like BMAD and OpenSpec, which are forms of context engineering. They essentially break down spec driven development with AI to properly conceptualize requirements, constraints, and execution steps before any code is written. With this approach, you greatly improve long context generation, and overall code quality, and results you typically wouldn't get from just sending a single prompt into a language model. And just this week, Google had introduced their very own specdriven framework, completely free and easy to access within Gemini CLI. It's called Conductor. Conductor is a contextdriven development framework for Gemini CLI. Conductor is a tool that helps you plan before you code by turning your intent specs as well as constraints into persistent markdown files alongside your code. It keeps context out of the chat logs and inside the repo and it's going to give AI agents consistent project awareness. And overall, this is going to improve your code quality as well as keeping you firm in control. And like I said, this works perfectly with Gemini CLI. And for those who do not know what Gemini CLI is, it's a command line interface for Google's Gemini AI models. And it lets you interact and manage as well as run AI workflows directly within your terminal. And the best part is is that this is something that is fully free to access where you don't even need to pay for APIs because you can access Gemini models completely for free. It's designed to make Aentic workflows contextdriven development as well as AI assisted coding seamless. So frameworks like conductor can easily plug in directly and turn your codebase into a single source of truth for AI agents. What's nice is the support for brownfield projects. Most development actually happens in existing code bases and that is where AI tools often struggle because of their lack of understanding of project history as well as the overall architecture context. But with conductor it is going to address this by creating and maintaining a living set of documents about your project's architecture guidelines and goals. As you add new features or tasks, Conductor is actually going to be updating this shared context list and it's going to allow its knowledge to grow alongside your project. So, think of it as a consistent memory as you keep using your codebase. And what's also nice is that conductor is also enabled for team level context. So, you can let it define your product tech stack and workflow preferences once so that your AI can generate contributions that follow the same standards. And overall, it's going to ensure consistent code quality, adherance to guidelines, and smoother onboarding for any sort of member that is working with your team, and making features feel like they were built from a single cohesive team. Before we get started, I just want to mention that you should definitely go ahead and subscribe to the World of AI newsletter. I'm constantly posting different newsletters on a weekly basis. So, this is where you can easily get up-to-date knowledge about what is happening in the AI space. So definitely go ahead and subscribe as this is completely for free. So to get started, it is super simple. All you got to do is have Google's Gemini CLI installed and you can easily install it with the mpm install command. So simply go ahead and open up your command prompt or WSL if you're on Windows and you want to use the Linux subsystem and then you can simply go ahead and paste in this command and you can install Gemini CLI. Now what you can then do is you can head over to the extension gallery within Gemini CLI and essentially they have it so that you can easily install conductor with a single command. So if you click on this you can install the Gemini extension which is the conductor extension and that is by just simply copying this command and once you have Gemini CLI installed you can then paste it in and install the Gemini extension conductor. After installing, you can easily start up using the Gemini command and you can just paste it in within your terminal. And this is where you can now start using all of the different conductor commands. There is a list of all of them which I'll leave in the description below. But essentially, first things first, you want to start off by establishing context. So you can use the /conductor setup command. So within the CLI, you can use this setup command and you can add it to uh define your project's foundation, whether that's a product or any sort of text stack that you're using or a workflow. You can easily use this command when you're first starting up Gemini. And by simply writing that, you're going to be able to see that it is going to welcome you to Conductor and it will guide you through the following steps to set up your project directory, the product definition, as well as the configurations so that you can then lastly track the generation. But you can see right here that it's going to ask you a couple of questions to fill out the configuration settings that you are looking to use this specriven framework for. So in this case it'll ask if you have an existing project directory and if so you can then continue yes or no so that it can then analyze it. It will also ask you that I will now help you create the product MD file and you just need to define the primary purpose of what you're trying to do. So in this case, if I want to use many of their predefined answers like something like A, which is to provide a reusable and accessible login form for a web application, I can just simply send in A. But if I was to type in D, where I type in my own answer, I can specify what I want the specdriven frameworks actually focus on. But in this case, you can see that it is drafting up the product guideline. And this is where the AI agent is going to follow through with these key features. And this is where you can even suggest changes where you can tell it to modify any of these product guidelines as well. Or you can simply go ahead and approve it if you like what you see. Then it's going to work on creating the product guideline file. This is where you can type in your own answer as to what you want the guideline to actually focus on. So this is where you can specify the detailed requirements, explain what and why, as well as an actionable to-do list breaking down the phases. This is something that is pretty key so that it is going to be able to follow through with the specd driven workflow. And what I really like about conductor is that it goes into the meticulous detail a part of your project where you need to specify the programming language, the framework, the styling. You can specify each and every component so that your Gemini model is able to have the context to thoroughly code out and build what you're looking for. And the great thing is is that this is something that has the ability to use Gemini's long context. So you're going to be able to get the best generations out of this. Now, something that you can also do is use many of these other generated artifact commands. And this is where you can add a new track. So essentially, if you want to add a new feature, you can specify the specs for that. and you're going to work with the Gemini CLI conductor extension to help you specify what sort of new feature or bug you want to basically tackle. And after you have refined this overall plan, you can implement the track using the conductor implement command. Now, since we have already started working with this to create and refactor the login form component to use a modern React context for the state management, we can then have it work on doing all of this. So it has it so that this workflow will start from setting up the project where it asks me a couple questions, start a new track where it will specify the specs that you want to basically add and then it's going to implement it autonomously for you as well. But this is essentially the workflow and the use of commands that you can use if you're looking to basically implement different sorts of products or different sorts of text stacks to your app. And if you do not know what sort of command that you want to use for any sort of feature, just reference this command reference sheet which will give you a good understanding where you can use the new track command to start up a new feature or bug track. The implement command to start having it code out the specdriven workflow that you had developed with the conductor. And then you also have a status one which displays the current progress. You can even revert to a checkpoint or a certain phase and just take a look at the quality of output. This is where it was able to create that modern login form component which uses the modern React context for the state management instead of the different prop drilling as well as maintaining its performance. And you can see that it was able to add animations. It was able to create this clear authentication all on its own and quite easily. And this is something that you can easily do with conductor cuz it keeps AI context persistent and structured and it's going to turn your project in into actionable specs and plans. This is where it is overall going to improve the code quality as well as the consistency and let you stay in control while AI actually handles the execution. So, this is something that I highly recommend that you use because it will overall save you a lot of time when you're generating and vibe coding as well as helping you with saving tokens and basically just improving your efficiency.
