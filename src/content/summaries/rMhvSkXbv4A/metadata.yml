  // Abstract

  Agents sound smart until millions of users show up. A real talk on tools, UX,
  and why autonomy is overrated.


  // Bio

  Chiara Caratelli

  Chiara is a Data Scientist at Prosus, where she develops AI-driven solutions
  with a focus on AI agents, multimodal models, and new user experiences. With a
  PhD in Computational Science and a background in machine learning engineering
  and data science, she has worked on deploying AI-powered applications at
  scale, collaborating with Prosus portfolio companies to drive real-world
  impact.


  Beyond her work at Prosus, she enjoys experimenting with generative AI and
  art. She is also an avid climber and book reader, always eager to explore new
  ideas and share knowledge with the AI and ML community.


  Alex Salazar

  Alex is the CEO and co-founder of Arcade.dev, the unified agent action
  platform that makes AI agents production-ready. Previously, Salazar co-founded
  Stormpath, the first authentication API for developers, which was acquired by
  Okta. At Okta, he led developer products, accounting for 25% of total
  bookings, and launched a new auth-centric proxy server product that reached
  $9M in revenue within a year. He also managed Okta's network of over 7,000
  auth integrations. Alex holds a computer science degree from Georgia Tech and
  an MBA from Stanford University.
