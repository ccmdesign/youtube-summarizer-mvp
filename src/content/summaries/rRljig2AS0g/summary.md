  You probably know Intercom… but did you know they recently incubated a new startup called Fin (https://fin.ai/) that has already surpassed the core business? 
  
  They’ve pulled off a massive transition to an AI-native product and design org so today we’re going behind-the-scenes with their VP of Design Emmet Connolly (https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmetconnolly/).
  
  Some highlights:
  
  - Why Emmet believes designers will own the frontend
  - The opportunity for design systems in an AI-first world
  - What Emmet looks for when hiring designers in the AI era
  - Why liquid glass represents the wrong direction for design
  - How Intercom’s AI product Fin overtook their core business
  - Why the start of an S-curve is the best time to be a designer

  Emmet Connolly argues that the AI era requires designers to proactively disrupt themselves by moving closer to code and embracing a **generalist mindset**. Intercom's shift from legacy SaaS to an AI-native leader with **Finn** demonstrates that designers must transition from drawing "pictures of products" in Figma to shipping **production code** to survive the vertical climb of the innovation S-cu

## Key Takeaways

Emmet Connolly explores the necessary evolution of the design discipline as AI shifts from a feature to the core product architecture.

* **Proactive Self-Disruption**: Intercom pivoted to focus on **Finn**, their AI agent, recognizing that as an incumbent, they were the primary targets for disruption by AI-native startups.

* **The Design Pinser Movement**: Designers should engage in both high-level **vibe coding** (rapid prototyping with tools like Lovable) and low-level **production PRs** to eliminate the "lossy" handoff between design and engineering.

* **Agentic vs. CRUD UIs**: Future software will likely follow a pattern of **agentic by design, CRUD under the hood**, where conversational agents handle primary tasks while traditional forms remain for granular control.

* **S-Curve Navigation**: We are currently in the vertical growth phase of the AI S-curve, which historically favors **generalists** over specialists because the "rules" of the medium are still being written.

* **Skin in the Game**: Shipping production code provides a "dopamine hit" and a feedback loop that Figma cannot replicate, moving designers out of "Plato’s Cave" and into the reality of the user experience.

## Summary

### The Strategic Pivot to AI-Native Design
Emmet Connolly describes the "dawning realization" at Intercom when ChatGPT was released, leading to a rapid internal pivot. Intercom, a decade-old SaaS company, chose to proactively disrupt itself by incubating **Finn**, an AI customer service agent. This shift wasn't just about adding features; it was a fundamental reorganization of the company. Connolly highlights that for a legacy business to survive, it must act like an **AI-native startup**. This involved moving away from the traditional "triad" model (Product, Engineering, Design) toward **centralized workstreams** with a single Direct Responsible Individual (DRI) to increase velocity.

### Designing the Training Workflow
One of the primary design challenges was moving Finn's out-of-the-box resolution rate from 24% to over 60%. Connolly explains that the "surface area" of an AI agent is deceptively small, but the background complexity is massive. Designers had to create an **Analyze, Train, Test, Deploy** loop. This requires helping users understand what the AI doesn't know (Analysis), providing it with company-specific data (Training), and verifying improvements (Testing). The challenge lies in determining the right level of control: giving users too much access to **system prompts** can "tank" the resolution rate, while too little makes the system feel rigid.

### The Designer-as-Coder Paradigm
Connolly is a vocal advocate for designers shipping **production code**. At Intercom, designers are encouraged to set up local dev environments and fix "P3" bugs or polish UI directly in the codebase. He uses the analogy of **Plato's Cave** to describe designers who only work in Figma: they are looking at shadows of reality rather than the product itself. By shipping code, designers gain "skin in the game" and a tangible pride in the final output. This shifts the relationship with engineers from a frustrating, detailed handoff to a more efficient **front-end/back-end split**, where designers own the entire presentation layer.

### Material Exploration and "Vibe Coding"
The traditional linear design process (wireframe to high-fidelity) is often ineffective for AI products because the "shape of the data" is unpredictable. Connolly suggests a **material exploration** phase where designers work with ML scientists using spreadsheets and rough prototypes to see if a concept is even technically feasible. He highlights tools like **Cursor**, **Lovable**, and **Granola** as part of a new "vibe coding" movement. These tools allow designers to create 70% functional prototypes rapidly, which can then be productized once the core value is proven. 

### The Future of Design Systems and Research
As design roles become more fluid, **Design Systems** and **Design Ops** become more critical. In a centralized model, the design system serves as the "connective tissue" that allows disparate workstreams to remain cohesive. Connolly also predicts a shift in **user research**. Rather than just optimizing button placements, research will focus on **foundational strategy** and potentially utilize AI to perform "automated lint testing" of UX patterns. Ultimately, the most successful designers of the next era will be those who combine **deep systems thinking** with the technical ability to manipulate their medium directly, embracing the identity of a **technical generalist** over a narrow craft specialist.

## Context

Emmet Connolly is the VP of Design at Intercom and previously spent years at Google. He is widely respected in the design community for his writings on product strategy and the "jobs to be done" framework. This interview occurs at a critical juncture in the tech industry: the transition from traditional SaaS to AI-agent-centric platforms. 

This conversation contributes to the broader debate about the "death of UX" and the necessity for designers to learn to code. Connolly provides a more optimistic counter-narrative, suggesting that AI tools actually lower the barrier for designers to reclaim the "craft" of building real products. This is essential viewing for design leaders at established companies trying to navigate "innovator's dilemma" type threats from AI startups, as well as individual designers looking to future-proof their careers by moving closer to the technical implementation of their work.
