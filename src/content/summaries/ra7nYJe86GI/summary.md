    _______________________

    What's really happening with disposable software and AI-native development? The common story is that vibe coding will replace enterprise SaaS — but the reality is more complicated.


    In this video, I share the inside scoop on why the disposable software discourse gets it wrong:


    \ • Why software cost collapsed but attention cost did not

    \ • How Cursor's philosophy works for developers but breaks for CIOs

    \ • What proactive AI means versus just bolting on a chatbot

    \ • Why 95% of the market needs a completely different strategy


    Cursor can ship multiple times a day because their customers are developers who tolerate variance. Salesforce cannot because their customers buy reliability — something they don't have to think about. That's not a temporary gap. It's a fundamental difference in what customers pay for.


    For enterprise builders, the opportunity isn't shipping like Cursor — it's earning the right to deploy proactive AI that creates value customers didn't know they were missing.

tldr: "The 'disposable software' trend, where AI drastically lowers coding costs, is misunderstood—it's viable for AI-native tools targeting developers (like Cursor), but fails for enterprise software (like Salesforce) where customers buy reliability, not features, requiring a 'proactive AI' strategy built on trust."

## Key Takeaways

The video argues that the 'disposable software' trend is being misapplied because people confuse two different phenomena and ignore critical constraints.

*   **Disposable software is two distinct categories:** 1) **Throwaway personal apps** (a net positive), and 2) **Disposable features in enterprise products** (dangerous if misapplied).

*   **The real constraint is attention, not software cost:** While AI makes code generation cheap, the cost of directing focus, maintaining, and securing software remains high, creating massive **opportunity costs**.

*   **Most of the market buys reliability, not features:** Enterprise customers (CIOs) purchase software like Salesforce for 'peace of mind' and stability, making a philosophy of constant, breaking changes incompatible.

*   **The winning strategy depends on your customer:** For AI-native/developer tools, **maximize speed and disposability**. For enterprise software, first **prove reliability**, then build trust to deploy **proactive AI agents** that act autonomously and correctly.

## Summary

The core argument is that the collapsing cost of code generation via AI has created a 'disposable software' era, but its implications are wildly different depending on the market you serve. The video dismantles the one-size-fits-all hype by highlighting a critical, often-ignored distinction.

### The Two Faces of Disposable Software
First is **throwaway personal software** (e.g., a vacation app), a democratizing force. Second is **disposable features within products**, championed by companies like Cursor. Their 'code is reality' philosophy treats planning, specs, and meetings as waste, prioritizing constant shipping and iteration based on user feedback.

### Why the Hype is Wrong for Most Markets
This philosophy works for Cursor because its customers are **developers**, who tolerate instability for innovation. However, it fails for the vast enterprise market where customers are **CIOs** buying 'peace of mind' and reliability through multi-year contracts and SLAs. They want software that works the same way next quarter as it does today.

The fatal flaw in the 'vibe-code everything' argument is that **attention, not software cost, is the ultimate constraint**. Diverting a high-paid team's focus from a core business opportunity to build and maintain an internal tool has a massive opportunity cost. Furthermore, AI-generated code often introduces **security vulnerabilities** and a hidden **maintenance burden**.

### The Correct AI Strategy: Context-Dependent
Therefore, strategy must bifurcate:

*   **For AI-native/developer tools (Cursor's game):** The imperative is **maximum speed**. Ship constantly, accept that interfaces are temporary, and use a **simple interface** (like a terminal) that can absorb change without disrupting users.

*   **For enterprise software (Salesforce's game):** The goal is **proactive reliability**. You cannot start with disposability. Step one is proving foundational reliability (uptime, security, support). Only then can you earn the trust to deploy **proactive AI agents**—AI that takes correct autonomous action (e.g., analyzing sales calls, drafting follow-ups) without being asked, creating value the user didn't know they were missing.

## Context

This analysis is critical for software founders, product leaders, and investors navigating the AI disruption. It provides a essential framework for strategic planning by segmenting the market not by technology, but by customer psychology (developer vs. CIO) and the core value proposition (innovation speed vs. reliable operation). It connects the technical trend of cheap code generation to fundamental business decisions about organization, product philosophy, and competitive moats.
