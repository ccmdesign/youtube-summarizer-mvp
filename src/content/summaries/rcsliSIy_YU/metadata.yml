title: Automating Large Scale Refactors with Parallel Agents - Robert Brennan,
  AllHands
description: >-
  Today's agents are best at small, atomic coding tasks. Much larger tasks--like
  major refactors and breaking dependency updates--are highly automatable but
  hard to one-shot.


  In this session, we'll discuss patterns for orchestrating large-scale code
  changes with swarms of agents and a human in the loop.


  We'll also work through a concrete example: migrating an entire codebase from
  one React state management library to another.
