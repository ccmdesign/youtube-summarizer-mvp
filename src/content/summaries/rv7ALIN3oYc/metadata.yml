  What’s really happening with agentic context engineering for AI agents? 

  The common story is that bigger context windows and RAG magically solve AI memory — but that actually makes them dumber in many cases.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on building memory-first architectures for large language model agents:
  • Why naive “just add context” designs quietly degrade AI performance
  • How tiered memory, retrieval, and artifacts keep agents coherent
  • What common pitfalls break long-horizon agents in real workloads
  • Where ADK, ACE, and Manus point to a new agent OS

  Chapters:
  00:00 Understanding Agentic Context Engineering
  03:48 Principles of Memory-First Design
  11:11 Common Pitfalls in Agentic Memory Systems
  15:06 Use-Cases for Long-Running Agents

  If you’re an operator or builder, getting memory and context engineering right is now the difference between fragile AI demos and reliable automation at work.
