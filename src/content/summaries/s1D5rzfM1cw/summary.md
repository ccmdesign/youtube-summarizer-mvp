## Key Takeaways

The video argues that the landscape of software development has fundamentally shifted due to advanced AI capabilities.

*   **Generative AI models** (e.g., Opus 4.5, Gemini 3, GPT 5.2) are now exceptionally good at writing code, surpassing previous iterations and enabling significant productivity gains for complex tasks.

*   Leading developers, including **Linus Torvalds** and those at **Anti-Res**, acknowledge AI's superior coding ability for certain tasks and advocate for its serious adoption.

*   The recommended approach for developers is to move beyond manual "crafting code" and instead focus on **designing systems that can leverage AI to write code**, tackling large-scale projects more efficiently.

*   It's crucial to embrace AI for substantial development work rather than just minor tasks or tab completions, thereby multiplying developer output.

## Summary

The video, titled "99% of Developers Are STILL Coding Wrong in 2026," asserts that software development has undergone a permanent transformation, largely driven by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. This shift is not merely a continuation of previous trends since the advent of ChatGPT, but a distinct new phase marked by the extraordinary capabilities of current AI models.

Key figures in the tech industry, including the creator of Reddit, **Linus Torvalds** (the creator of Linux), and popular tech commentator Theo, all reportedly endorse this profound change. The central argument is that AI models such as **Opus 4.5**, **Gemini 3**, and even **GPT 5.2** have reached a level of sophistication where they are "really, really good at coding." This proficiency translates into dramatic improvements in development timelines; for instance, **Anti-Res** was able to complete four significant tasks in hours that would have previously taken weeks. Linus Torvalds himself is quoted as stating that AI is "better at writing code than he is," highlighting the superior efficiency and accuracy AI can now achieve.

The video emphasizes that AI is "no longer producing slop," a stark contrast to earlier iterations. Evidence of this growing capability is seen in projects like "Claude Cowwork," which was reportedly written entirely using Claude code. Consequently, some of the industry's top programmers are no longer writing code by hand, signifying a fundamental shift in their workflow and approach to development.

Based on a blog post from Anti-Res, the video outlines a clear call to action for developers: It's time to take AI seriously and use it to **multiply your capabilities**. This means moving beyond superficial applications like simple tab completions or five-minute projects. Instead, developers should leverage AI for "something big," pushing it to perform tasks and solve problems in ways they might not expect. The core advice is to **stop crafting code** manually, unless it's for the purpose of learning a new language or for personal enjoyment. The new paradigm involves **designing systems to write code**, effectively shifting the developer's role from a hands-on coder to an architect and orchestrator of AI-driven development processes. The video concludes by urging viewers not to fall into "anti-AI hype" and to embrace these new tools for enhanced productivity.

## Context

This video highlights a pivotal moment in software development, signaling a paradigm shift driven by advanced AI. It's crucial for **developers**, **team leads**, and **tech executives** to understand that AI is no longer a supplementary tool but a core component of the development lifecycle. This shift affects productivity, skill requirements, and the fundamental approach to building software. Embracing this change can lead to unprecedented efficiency, while resisting it could result in being left behind in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. This trend connects to the broader movement of **AI augmentation** across various professional fields, emphasizing intelligence amplification over automation replacement.
