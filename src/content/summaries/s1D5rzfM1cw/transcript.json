  "fullText": "Software development has changed forever. The creator of Reddit believes it. Linus Strawvolds, the Linux guy believes it, and Theo has been banging on about it in his latest videos. People have been saying this since the dawn of chat GPT. But this year, this year is different because the models Opus 4.5, Gemini 3, and even GPT 5.2 are really, really good at coding. Anti-res was able to knock out four big tasks in hours instead of weeks. Linus Tvoltz in one of his PRs says that anti-gravity is better at writing code than he is. And the new Claude Cowwork was written entirely with Claude code. AI is no longer producing slop and some of the best programmers in the industry are no longer writing code by hand. So what should you do? According to this blog post from Anti-Res, it's time to take AI seriously and use it to multiply yourself. No more tab completions, no 5-minute projects. Use it for something big and push it to do things you won't expect it to do. Unless you're learning a new language for fun, stop crafting code and start designing systems to write code. Don't fall into the anti-AI hype.",
