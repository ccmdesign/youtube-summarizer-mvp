  "fullText": "My name is David Andre and here is how to build anything with open code. Now, this might actually be the cloth code killer because open code is currently the fastest growing coding agent in the world and as you can see on this chart, it just became more popular than cloth code. It's also completely free, works with over 70 different AI models, and you can choose any LLM provider you want. So, in this video, I'll show you how to set up Open Code, how it compares to Cloth Code, and how you can build anything with it. So, if you want to be at the cutting edge of AI coding, watch until the end. Now, as you can see, Open Code has been blowing up recently. In the last 30 days, it went from popular to super popular. So, let me show you how to install it. First off, go to opencode.ai, which is their main website. Now, you have multiple different ways to install it through a terminal, but the curl command is the most general one. So, just click on it and copy open terminal. Boom. And all you have to do is just paste in the curl command, hit enter. This is going to install the latest version of Open Code. Now, as you can see, I had 1.1.10, and now it updated to 1.16. Now, it's very important that you have the latest version because this comes with some pretty big updates, but more on that later. Now, after install finishes, the next terminal command we need to run is open code of login. This will let us select which provider we want to use. And just to show you how many there are, let me go through them. Yeah, you can see that open code really does offer so many different ways to use it. Which means that if you have a subscription with one of these or if you have API key from any of these, you can use open code at no extra cost. This is completely open source. It's free software which makes it much more appealing than close code. Now, because I want to show you a lot of different models, I'm going to use open router and then it asks for API key. So, go to open router.ai, create an account, takes 20 seconds. Go to top right, click on keys, then click on create API key. I'm going to name it subscribe. If you're watching this and if you want to see more AI tutorials, make sure to subscribe. Takes 20 seconds and it helps out a lot. Okay, let's click on create and let's copy this API key. Let's go back to the terminal and paste it in. Boom. Enter. And just like that, the setup is complete. It's literally that simple. Now you can use open code straight from the terminal but it always helps to have an IDE to kind of see what it's building right so I'm going to open an empty folder right here boom project and I'm using cursor but you can use VS code win serve anti-gravity doesn't really matter let me open the terminal right here and I'm going to type in open code and just like that boom open code is launched cool the first thing is setting a model you can do that by typing /models now remember we're still in the terminal so this is a CLI app but look at the UI very intuitive very nice so since we're using open router we can use any model on there which is basically every model But right now, Clo Opus 4.5 is the best. So, let's use that. And the first thing I want to show you is oneshoting a 3D game. So, I'm going to paste in a prompt. Create a 3D endless runner game using Vanilla TypeScript and 3JS. Then it explains the structure of the folders, features, player controls, and glowing cube that dodges incoming obstacles on a procedurally generated neon create road. So, this is a full 3D game, okay? This is not a simple, you know, single file HTML website. This is a legit project. Now, let's see how open code handles this. First, it creates a to-do list, right? list of tasks that it's going to do. So, it doesn't jump straight into writing code. It first thinks and creates a list of to-dos on how to best accomplish this goal. Then, it created a directory. So, it run command. And look at the UI, guys. There's some people think that open code is even more polished than close code. But man, look at this. Very clean, very separated colors when it makes sense and also fast. On top of that, you see the exact amount of tokens in the top right as well as the percentage of the context window and the current cost. Let's scroll down. As you can see, it marks the to-dos as complete one by one when it completes them. and highlighting anything instantly copies it to your clipboard. These little details really make or break these tools. Open code is very polished. It's very clean and unlike close code is fully open source. So you don't have to be afraid of them collecting your data or not knowing what's the inner workings of it. You can literally go to the open code GitHub and go through all the files yourself. Check out what's inside forkit. Build your own version of open code. Whatever you want to do with it. All right, let's see how the game is going. still building and you can see even even the bottom left very nice UI like the loader animation to show you that the agent is still working. Okay, we're on the last to-do now. All files have been created. Let me verify the project compiles correctly. It does npm install. And by the way, I'm in build mode. I didn't have to approve a single thing. You can switch between build and plan by simply pressing tab. And if you're in build, the agent is very autonomous, very powerful, and requires way less input than cloud code. So let's see. Test server. Okay, server start. And boom. All right, it's done. Took 3 minutes. Single prompt. Let's see if it works. npm install and npm rundef. This is the command. So, let's highlight this. And again, it autocopies to the clipboard. So, I'm going to do Ctrl +V to paste this and hit enter. There we go. Here we have our local host URL. And here we are. No errors so far. Okay, incoming projectiles controls work really well, guys. This is a single oneshot prompt and we have a 3D game. What if we crash? Let's see. Okay, crashing doesn't Oh, it works. Okay, beautiful. Game over. Restart. Not bad. And again, single prompt. So, we could work on this. We could add different camera angles, different obstacles, multiple levels. Yeah, not bad at all. But if you think this 3D game is crazy, just wait until you see what's coming. Now, before I show you more open code features, let's talk about the recent drama which caused Open Code to get worse, but also get better because it blew up. Let me explain. Few days ago, Enthropic, the company behind Cloed third party apps, including Open Code, from using the cloth credentials. So before you could use your claw subscription inside of open code which was stealing away from users from cloud code. Now this is a very aggressive move from entropic and it also tells you how valuable these models are to other companies. Simply put everyone wants to use enthropic models right now. Even XAI the you know creators of Grog were using cloth opus 4.5 to help them build software but Enthropic also shut that down to prevent competing AI labs from using cloth to build their own software and their own models. However, this move by Enthropic quickly started to backfire. Then the team behind Open Code pivoted quickly and they partnered with OpenAI and GitHub so that people can use these subscriptions inside of Open Code. So if you're paying for CIGBD Pro or CIGD Plus, you can use that subscription in Open Code for free to use models inside of Open Code, which again this is a huge danger to the popularity of cloth code. And this goes to show just how ruthless and competitive the AI field is getting. Now, for the second build I'm going to show you, we're going to be using Gemini 3 Pro and we're going to build a CRM dashboard for email campaigns. And again, I'm going to try to oneshot it with open code. So, open the terminal again. Type in open code. And first off, let me change the model to Gemini 3.0 Pro. There we go. I'm going to paste in my prompt. Build a CRM dashboard for email campaigns using React, Vite, and Tailwind. So, again, we describe the structure of the codebase, then the features. So, this is not a single feature. This is a full CRM that we're going to try to oneshot with Open Code. And again, I want to stress this. This is a single pro, right? In the previous one, we didn't run into any errors, no issues, one prompt, and it was a full working 3D game. Now, we're trying more of a business application, a full CRM dashboard. So, let's see if Open Code can handle that. And of course, since Open Code is a CLI tool, you can just open another one. Open code. Boom. And we can have two Open Code agents running at the same time. And just to compare the UI to cloud code, let me load up cloth. Boom. So, again, even that one confirmation step where you have to give it access to this folder, it's annoying, right? So cloth cloth code is very optimal UI, very clean. It pioneered a lot of this. It invented a lot of this. But open code I feel like it's it's more beginner friendly. It's cleaner and in some ways it's more polished and more optimized and gives you more info. For example, again you can see the tokens, the percentage of the context window and the cost in clo that's not possible. Even this is a custom status line that I had to build myself to see the model and to see the git branch and the time. I had to create it myself. It doesn't come by default in cloth code. But all of these things that I'm showing you in Open Code come by default. All right, again 3 minutes almost the same time as last time and Gemini 3 Pro is finished. So let's see if Open Code managed to oneshot this application. So again, we get clear instructions on how to run. So let me copy this. And again, highlighting only copies it like such a quality of life. Simple highlighting automatically copies that text, man. Amazing. Boom. Let's open our app. Here's our CRM. Okay, no errors. First try. Let's see if the contact page works. Add contact. Testing agent zero. Create contact. Okay, contact was added. Let's see if we can delete Alice. We can. Nice. Campaigns. Let's see the campaigns. New campaign. Man, all the features work. Let's see the analytics. But not bad. Personally, the UI feels a bit vibe coded. So again, we could use Gemini say like go over the entire front end and make the UI more unique. Notice the details. Open code shows you the model and it shows you the provider. Stuff like this is just quality of life. It saves seconds when building. But if you're serious and if you're building a lot of software with multiple agents running, you want to know which Open Code instance is using which model, which provider, stuff like that. And you can see the thinking blocks are a bit less uh visible, less opaque, which makes it very clear of what is internal thinking of the model and what are the changes that it makes. And by the way, this is the default theme. If you want to change the theme, just type in slash theme and open code has very wide selection of different themes that you can choose from. For example, the matrix one is going to make you feel like you're in the matrix. So you can customize this a lot. Cloth code has like a couple of themes, but everybody uses default one. Open code is built from the people at Neoim. So they know how to use terminal. They know how to use CLI tools and how to build them and how to make it as polished as possible and as customizable as possible. All right, let's see how these changes look so far. Man, much better. This is way more unique, right? This doesn't look like a vibe coded default, you know, blue buttons. This has some personality. It has that CLI feel. Very nice. So, yeah, Jman i3 is really good at front end. But again, this is only the second build. In this video, I'm going to show you five different apps that Open Code can build. And so far, it's been able to oneshot the first one and the second one. So let's see if open code lives up to the hype and if it's actually better than cloud code, cursor and codex. Now let me clarify what open code actually is because people are getting confused since there's new AI tools coming out every single week. And especially if you're new to AI, you're not sure which tool does what and or when you should use each of these tools. So Open Code is an AI coding agent. It runs in your terminal aka CLI command line interface. But they also have a desktop app which is more beginner friendly. And since it's a powerful coding agent, it can execute multi-step tasks across your codebase. But it's not a full IDE like cursor. It's not a full ID like VS Code or anti-gravity or Windsurf. It is a coding agent. So once again, think of it as cloud code that is open source with more AI models and with no restriction on what provider you're using. But let's go deeper. Let's actually compare it to clot code which probably is the most popular coding agent of all time. And I feel like I can speak confidently on this issue because personally I have well over 500 hours inside of Cloud Code. I made dozens videos on it. I've been using it since day one. So if there's somebody who knows Cloud Code, it's me. So let me show you how Open Code compares. Now first off, both of them run in the terminal. Both of them are coding agents that are in the CLI. But that's where the similarities end. Open code unlike OpenAI is actually open source with a MIT license. Cloth code is closed source. There are some things that Enthropics has released, but closed code is closed, open code is open. This is huge if you care about privacy and security. Open code also supports over 70 different AI models. Anything from OpenAI, Gemini, Enthropic, XAI, Deep Seek, Kimmy, GLM, so many different models, closed models, open models, everything basically. Well, closed code only supports cloud models, right? Because it's made by Enthropic. Also, there's a big difference between open code and closed code. With Open Code, you can use GitHub Copilot as the back end, as the service, right? And that only costs $10 a month and you get 500 premium requests. This means it's very cost- effective compared to Cloth Code. Close code, while it has some extra features, is way more expensive, right? Most people are running either the $100 a month or the $200 a month plan in Cloud Code, which simply isn't affordable for most people. And these extra features, they're coming fast. The Open Code team is developing quickly because of the fact that it's open source. the entire open source community can contribute and improve the project much faster which creates a very interesting dynamic of like enthropic against the whole world which is a tough battle for cloud code to win. So to summarize open code gives you all of the main cloud core features for a fraction of the cost plus it's open source. Now let's go to the third build idea which again I'm going to try to oneshot with open code but this time we're going to use GPD 5.2 to Codex and I'm trying to show you that really you can use any model you want instead of open code which is one of the main selling points. This time we're going to do something very different. We're going to do a TLR/PF Photoshop clone for the web. So this is like image editing uh you know mirror dashboard drawing board. You'll see I'm going to change the model to GBT 5.2.2. Okay, seems like GBD 5.2 CEX is not available on Open Router. So let's do /exit to exit the open code UI and we're going to try to login with my CHBD subscription. So again type in open code of login. We're going to select open AI as the login method and you have two options. You can either use API key or you can use your CHD subscription which a lot of people are paying $20 a month for CHD plus or $200 a month for CHVD Pro which again makes open code completely free for you. So let's hit enter. It's going to redirect us to this website. Let's open that up. Okay. Authenticator. As always, make sure to use TFA, guys. Don't be sloppy. So, I have two options. Either use my workspace or personal account. Let's use personal account because I have the $200 a month JGBT Pro subscription. So, let's use the best possible subscription. Now, we can return to open code. And we're done, right? Let's do clear open code. And we should be logged in through OpenAI. Still says open router. That's weird. Let's do models. I think that's a bug. But now we can use GBD 5.2 Codex. There we go. You can see that we're in OpenAI. I think it remembers the Open Router. Oh, yeah. Because it's selected from before. There we go. Now it shows OpenAI as the provider. Very nice. So, we're using GBD5. Codex, which is the best coding model from OpenAI right now. And I'm going to paste in the prompt. Boom. Build a web-based drawing and design editor using React V CSS and Convjs for canvas rendering. Again, structure description of features. And this is how your prompt should be if you want to oneshot apps, right? So this prompt, it's not short, but it's not super long either. It's like medium length, single paragraph with clear description of the text tag, of the build idea and the features. So if you want to build as fast as possible and if you want these coding agents to actually oneshot your apps without running into endless errors, feel free to pause the video and make sure to structure your prompts like this. All right, so first again creates a list of to-dos. Then it checks the current directory, sees that it's empty, creates the necessary subdirectories. There we go. Writes the first file package.json. JSON then it writes the V config moving very fast. GB 5.2 CEX is very fast. And since I already have the GBD Pro subscription, this is running for free for me. There's no extra cost, right? So if you're already paying 20 bucks a month for GGBT or $200 a month, start using open code. You don't have to pay for cloud code. You can just use your subscription and leverage it in more ways because let's be honest, most of us are not hitting the limits. You know, this is not 2023 when GBD4 limits were super small and we were hitting it every two hours. It's the big 2026 like limits are high. So we want to make sure we squeeze the most out of them and we run multiple coding agents in parallel leveraging our existing subscriptions instead of paying lots of money to enthropic which u yeah often times is not going to the best uh pockets. Okay so you can see that GBD5.2 codex is moving very fast much faster than Opus and Gemini 3. Let's see the total time if it's going to be around 3 minutes as well or if it's going to be faster. And if you don't like something again, you can fork it. You can build your own version or you can do a PR to the official GitHub repository suggesting a certain change. And if your idea is good, the team will likely accept it. And notice in the top right, $0 spent because I'm using my existing subscription. Man, amazing. Another benefit of using open code overload code is that you have single interface for all your models, right? So if you wanted to use the native CLI tools like Gemini CLI, cloud code, codec cli, all of these look completely different. All of these have different slash commands, you know, different tools. Open code, you just get used to one tool. You pick your theme, you do slash init. Okay, that's another thing. If you start in a codebase that is existing, start with slashinit. This will initialize the agents.mmd file. So it will analyze every single file and learn your codebase and put everything into agents.mmd. If you don't know what agents is, this is a convention that is like a readme file for agents. I think it's developed by OpenAI originally, but I think they gifted it to the Linux Foundation if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, it's under the Linux Foundation and it's adopted by a lot of different tools including Open Code, but of course cloud code doesn't adopt agents.md. So all of these tools, look at them. Jules, Goose, Ader, Windsor, Warp, AMP, Root Code, GitHub, Copilot, Codeex, Kilo Code, they use the agents.mmd file. What that means is that inside of your codebase, actually, let me show you. Let me just show you in practice, right? Let's launch a second open code agent. Boom. Let me put it up. And I'm going to do slashinit. Enter. And it has this pre-prepared prompt, which is very nice. Please analyze this codebase and create an agent.mmd file containing number one, build lint test commands, especially for running a single test. Number two, code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc. This prompt is really good guys. Take note. The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents such as yourself that operate in this repository. Make it about 150 lines long. If there are any cursor rules in that cursor rules or cursor rules or copilot rules, make sure to include them. If there's already an agent.mmd, improve it if it's located in root. Very nice prompt, concise. Great job to the open code team for writing this. And as you can see, open code begins analyzing the entire codebase. Listed out directory. check out all the files and starts reading them and learning about this project and then it will create this agents.md file which more and more coding agents use. So if you don't have an agent.mmd file, what are you doing? This is a super fast way of improving the performance of nearly every coding agent out there on your codebase. This is probably the difference why like a lot of beginners don't get the power out of AI while people who know how to prompt it, know how to use it do get the power because they have stuff like ages.mmd file. Now, Codex is still going, not because it's slower, but because it's probably overthinking like look how many changes it's doing, right? It's writing so many files, so many things. And this is very uh this is very iconic of GPD 5.2 CX. It's a model that likes to think a lot. So, this is both good and bad. If you're fixing something that is a problematic bug that you've been battling for hours or days, GBD5.2 CEX will put in the work. it will reason for 10 15 20 minutes which again opens or gemini do not do but if you're trying to build something quickly like I'm right now it's can be a bit annoying because GPD codex models have a tendency to overthink it's almost done and you can see how the second open code agent is running in parallel so both are running at the same time and this one is building the agents MD file and it's editing it one by one it's describing the history and again this means that any agent in the future you run this is loaded as the system code and it will instantly make that agent more powerful more aware where it will give it more context about this codebase which is essential. Context is the difference between bad performance and good performance when it comes to AI agents. So this is done 2 minutes 48 to create the agents.md file. Pretty slow I would say but look at this very nice prompt. Very very clean formatting. Wow 145 lines. So the full app took almost 7 minutes. So longer than Opus and Gemini but let's see maybe it's impressive. Maybe it's worth it. Let's jump in install again. And we need to do npm rundev. npm rundev. Boom. Go to local host. And here we are. So let's uh let's see what's happening. Can we like take a screenshot and paste this in? Let me take a screenshot here. Not sure. Okay, let's do pencil. Pencil works. Let's change the color. Maybe it works. Very nice. Rectangles. Rectangles work. And I can move around. Okay. I can zoom in and zoom out. Let's do ellipse. Ellipse works. Opacity. Let's do lines. See how good lines are. Okay. Lines work as well. Let's do text. Let me change this. Not sure if we can change the text. Export as PNG. Let's export this as PNG. Download this to the same folder. Nice. We can actually export this as PNG. Not bad. So, obviously, this is not as advanced as Photoshop, but again, one shot, no editors, and it's a simplified version of TLJ. And we can see the layers right here. And we can like log, unlock, up and down, do a lot of different changes that you could do in something like Photoshop. So, this is interesting because uh TL Draw doesn't have these layers. So, it already has one more feature that the draw doesn't have. And again, it's not as polished, but again, it's one-shoted, no errors, super impressive. Open code free for free so far. There's two more to go. Let's see if it can keep up 100% oneshot rate with zero errors. Now, let's talk about what makes open code really appealing. And a big part of that is the CLI experience. So, the terminal UI is generally impressive. This is what it looks like in the default theme. And again, they have like 20 30 different themes. The CLI includes automatic prompt summarization, to-do lists, desk notifications. It's really, really good. Maybe even better than cloth code, honestly. And of course, just like in cursor, just like in cloth code, there's plan mode and there's build mode. So, you can switch with tab. You don't need to do shift tab, just tab to let the agents try first. Really good tip for VIP coding. And the reason why the CLI experience is so good is because it's by past Neoim team, right? So these guys know how to code. They know what the terminal, how to use the terminal, what it should look like, what a good interface for console should look like and it tells. Another benefit of open code is that it supports agents.mmd. This is a convention that was started by OpenAI, but clot code doesn't. Right? So I already talked about this, but cloth code still doesn't support agents.md. Open code does. If you wanted to have global, it needs to be in the root of your computer. If you wanted to have per project like I showed you earlier, it needs to be hgn. MD and just do slashinit in the project and it will create it by itself. But make sure to do the slashinit. Do not forget that. If you're starting from a scratch, it's not as important, but if you were going to use open code on your existing codebase, definitely do so. So now let's get to the fourth build idea, which I'm going to use GLM 4.7, which might be the best coding model that's open source right now. And we're going to build an encrypted and private file manager software which is something that I actually need for myself because u as the world is becoming more centralized and governments and companies want more of your data. We should be very careful what we upload online because basically anything can be used against you since every country has like tens hundreds of thousands of laws. Nobody knows what they are. Having your data encrypted and private is a really good idea. So we're going to build this. We need to type in GLM4.7. There we go. Through open router. And as you can see, it remembers the sessions, right? So it remembers the connection to open router and it remembers the authentication to open AAI chd subscription and you don't have to like reoff every time. It's very seamless to switch, very clean. Yeah, very convenient. So let me paste in the prompt for this one. And actually, let's start with plan mode. Plan mode sometimes asks you questions which is very helpful to get more context. A lot of you are making the mistake of of not giving the AI enough context. And that's why you don't have the same results as me or other people who are building super fast with AI and who can actually build production ready apps that grow into real serious startups is because we know how to provide context. Right? So as you can see, boom, it asked me six questions. So here are my answers. Boom. I'm going to do Ctrl J to go new line. Value location should value keep it simple. Default to out vault. Number two, file naming. Keep original names remain until locked. Number four, override behavior. Yes. Number five, recursive direction directory support. Should add support directories. Let's do single files for now. Number six, backup strategy. Not needed for now. Let's keep this a quick and dirty prototype. I really like that word. much better than MVP. Now, get to work and make this happen and build this app like a 10x engineer would. Boom. Press tab to switch to build mode and enter. And let's see how good GLM 4.7 is. On some benchmarks, it's similar to Sonet 4.5, which is the second best model from Entropic. Uh, probably won't be good as Opus, but let's see. Well, well, well. So, here we are. Uh, I quickly went to the gym and I'm back. But we seem to be stuck. So, I'm going to escape. This is how you interrupt, by the way. You need to press escape twice, which is also better than close code. In closed code, you need to do it once and sometimes you hit it by accident, which is annoying, right? So, I say, uh, what is the state? What happened? Now, I'm not sure if it actually ran into errors that it couldn't solve or if it's because I left the computer and went to the gym and, you know, it went to sleep. So I'm not going to quite dismiss it saying that it failed one shot because it might not be fair. The user is asking me what's the state. Let's see persistence issue. So it's trying something. Maybe it's not the best idea to use the least powerful model out of these because like Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2 CEX and Gemini 3 Pro are all better than GLM 4.7. But again, GLM 4.7 is fully open source, more like open weights, right? the other three models are not. So yeah, maybe it's maybe I should have given the hardest build idea to the best model. But let's see if GLM4.7 fixes this, then it's going to be real impressive. Not only on the model, but on open code as a coding agent, just giving it all the tools necessary and the prompting and the scaffolding to let the models cook. People don't realize the value of a good coding agent isn't just the model because you can have GLM 4.7 and you can just run it, you know, by the direct API call and it's going to work fine. But if you use it inside of open code, it's going to be probably a lot better because open code gives it the tools, the prompts, the environment to let it do its thing and it's goes in loops until it figures that out. So yeah the it remains to be seen what is the value of AI agents uh like against each other you know whether cloud core or or open code in a year will be much different or whether they'll be basically same because oh permission required I'm not running that command I am not running that command that is very risky I'm going to reject that and actually I'm going to rerun the idea uh in a new open code. So there is two feces I can say model. I'm going to do opus and it remembers the recent models. Wow, this is amazing. This is such a quality of life. If you use wind surf, oh my god, hopefully they fixed it. I used wind surf a few months ago. You had to retype the model from scratch. It's so bad. All right, so I'm going to give it this. I will say first analyze the state of the project then finish it like a 10x engineer would because we already have something you know we have SRC we have virtual environment but yeah the speed of software development is uh decreasing so like the the gaps are decreasing the speed is increasing and within 12 months it'll be like you know one prompt literally seconds to implement whole features so if cloud code implements something that people Open code is going to have it the next day or within a few days at most. Same thing vi vice versa. But there are some things you cannot change such as the privacy first approach, right? I mean this is why people love agent zero. It's locally runnable. It's open source. It's free. It's privacy first. It's security first. These things you cannot change, right? Enthropic is always going to be closed source. Enthropic is always going to train on your data. Enthropic is always going to do the best interest for the Silicon Valley crowd. Open code is open source, right? It's in the name. I mean, okay, it's in the name. That's not the best argument because OpenAI used to be open source and it's also in the name, but hopefully open code stays open source forever. But my point is that like the features and the speed of change can change, but the underlying print principles will not change. Closed code will likely always be closed source and will always collect your data and train on your data. So I I think these things will become more valuable in the future. The the underlying foundations that cannot be changed. We have some questions. Okay. And this is this is different rather than like Yeah, I like this. So before it asks me questions that I have to manually respond to, but now this is like the way Claw does it, right? Where you select the ones that seems good. Okay, keep it. And then we do confirm. Beautiful. Yeah, I really like this way of input. Rather than like having to type it, just multi select. Okay, so now we need to give it the go ahead. get to work and make it happen. Now, one thing that I will say about clot code, it's really good, is the prediction. They added it recently of your next prompt. So, see, look at this. The first thing cloth asks you is if you want to send more data to Enthropic. You're already sending them data and they're like, \"Do you want us to train on your prompts?\" No, I want you to train on my prompts. [ __ ] I'm paying $200 a month, stupid. And you but anyways do you see this? All I have to do is tap and it's like predicting my prompt. Uh I don't know why it's not working. Try write a test for file path. Hey okay let me send something but this is a really good feature inside of cloud code. I say yes there you go. You can see it predicted my prompt. All I have to do is press tab and it writes it there. This is a very useful feature that I would love to see in open code or in other tools because a lot of the time it's not correct every time but like I say 60 to 70% of the time it actually predicts the next thing you want to do and again saves you 10 20 30 seconds having to type the prompt which compounds quickly given how good and how fast the AI models are. So here we are in open code. It's still running into some errors but we're using a better mold now. So let's see if it does it. We can probably uh like this is a fail like I'm not running this that vault. That's crazy. Um I'm yeah I don't know what's in this folder. I don't know if it's a new folder here. It's not in this project directory. This is a global on my MacBook. That would be very risky to run a remove command. And this is a recursive deletion. Uh that's yeah that's bad. Don't just auto accept commands from AI agents. Okay. And this is another benefit of agent zero by the way. It runs in a docker container. So it wouldn't [ __ ] you up like this. Okay, so Opus is suggesting the same, but I really don't like that. Um, uh, these RM commands are super risky. How can I be sure this is safe to run? Is the vault folder used for anything else in our MacBook? Pink harder. Answer in short. Use terminal. You use save terminal commands to triple check answer in short. I'm not doing this. Can I open that vault in my MacBook uh finder? I really don't like these recursive deletion commands. Oh [ __ ] What the [ __ ] I didn't know open code could do that. It can open your finder like that. Wow, that is pretty good. I mean, it's just a terminal command, so maybe I'm just u not educated on terminal commands, but I didn't know it could like do that. Well, this saves a lot of time. Okay, sometimes in cursor you have to like click and like show in u reveal in finder and stuff like that. Well, damn, this is good. This is good. I'm impressed by open code that vault folder. Where is it? In David. Okay, so it's hidden folder. Open it again in Finder. And I want to see that again. This is fast influence on Opus, by the way. Did they improve it? Metadata. Okay. All of this was created now. Looks safe to delete. Try again. Try it again. There we go. That vault and echo cleaned up. Okay. Allow once. Yes, we don't want to allow remove commands always. There we go. End to end test code secret test content 34 creating new encrypted vault. So opus is doing better than GLM as expected. All right. I'm not sure how we're going to test this one because it's there's a issue consistency problem is that save will generates a new salt infernet but the file was encrypted old format. Okay. So it's fixing some inconsistencies. The type checker is catching these errors. See, I have no clue how the technical implementation of this is. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to use this one. Boom. Clear. Open code. And I'm going to say explain the technical side of this project. How does it actually work? Be concise. I'm going to switch to plan mode so it analyzes more files and reads it. And by the way, this is how I actually build. I have one agent that's the builder, the coding agent, and I have one that's like more of an adviser, more of a consultant that explains things. And I really try to upskill myself. A lot of you guys are just using AI to build [ __ ] for you, and you're not improving yourself. That's a huge loss. The best thing is, as the AI is exponentially improving, is to also exponentially improve your skill set. Change password. Verify file decing the RM command. All commands work. Okay, nice. So, it updates the to-dos. very nice and seems to be good. Even though it ran into some errors while building it, it managed to self fix them. This is really nice about open code is like it doesn't give up too early. The hardness is really good. All right, so let's see. Okay, what is this? Encrypted file CLI tool let you securely store retrieve files using as 256 encryption. Okay. Architecture user CLI vault class crypto vault encrypted files worker modules. How encryption works. All right. This is beyond the scope of this video, but all right. How do I test it? How can I actually test this myself with some files? Give me step by step. Answer in short. I'm going to give it some bigger file. I don't know how long it takes to encrypt. Maybe one of these video files. Okay. Like half a gigabyte. Check the files. I added 500 MB MP4. Is this good for test testing or will this take forever? I don't know if the encryption or decryption is slow. So, we'll see. Yes. Give me step by step how to try it with this file. Answer in short. I don't know why it's scared. I mean, worst case scenario, it's going to take 30 seconds like it said. Doors. Okay. And again, I'm going to show you the beauty of just highlighting Never mind. I'm just going to highlight the text and it's autocopied. Boom. Terminal. Paste it in. We have the VNV active. That's good. Now we need to Is it no vault? Okay. We need to do password. Okay. Confirm. Nice. Good design. Set value location.vault. Vault. Beautiful. I like that. Now we need to unlock it. Vault. Unlock. Password. I mistyped it. Uh hopefully it doesn't crash. Vault unlock. Okay, there we go. It's unlocked. What now? need to add this old add file. It has spaces in the name. That's not good. Okay, so this is the part that's going to take some time. It's in encrypting this file. We should have probably some um feedback in the CLI that it's showing that it works or like the progress of the encryption. Okay, that's wasn't that bad. It was like 20 seconds. Wasn't bad at all. So, let's do vault list. I need to probably decrypt. Doesn't need to decrypt the list of files. Probably. There we go. Original path. So, it's encrypted in the vault. This is nice. This is nice. Recover it to /temp. We don't need to do these. Oh, do these steps. It's fine. just tell me how to clear everything up once I'm done testing so that my MacBook isn't full of test files and uh that vault uh file that vault stuff whatever I'm going to be general I don't want to finish this like halfway okay we're going to remove the vault okay this they need to fix this one thing I don't like about over code is the scrolling. If I'm on my touchpad, it's super sensitive. Like look at this. I'm scrolling very slowly and it's like going crazy. So I really need to use a mouse with the scroll wheel. I have no clue. In CL code, this is not an issue. CL code has smooth scrolling. So they need to fix that. Also, sometimes you highlight stuff and it goes crazy up and down. So yeah, I don't know. Let's delete this. And that's it. Cool. So this was the CLI tool. Most complex one so far. Took the most amount of time. But uh Open Code managed to do it. Now, one thing you should understand is that Open Code works everywhere. It is a native desktop app, not just the CLI. I was showing you the CLI, you know, the tool for the terminal, but it has a clean desktop app. I'm going to pop up a screenshot right here. It also has an ID extension. So, if we go back into cursor, which of course is for of VS Code. If we type in open code, there we go. You can see it has the extension. So if you prefer using VS Code cursor and you just want to have the simplest way to install open code, maybe the extension is the way to start. And uh I like the terminal. It's the most developer friendly. But this the desktop app is definitely the most beginner friendly. So if you want to use open code, but you're scared of terminal, just install the desktop app. It's uh very very nice. And it's almost an ID. It's it's not a full ID, but it's getting there. It has a built-in terminal. You can change the project folder. You can change Git branches. Pretty good. As I said, the desktop app is surprisingly nice. It doesn't require you to use terminal or know anything about CLIs. That makes it great for beginners. But the CLI, if you are not afraid of the terminal, is one of the nicest designs and one of the best UIs out there. It might even be better UI than cloud code. There's a strong argument for that. Now, you should also know about open code Zen. So, Zen is the gateway service from Open Code. Now, again, it's optional. Open code is completely free. You can use your JGB subscription. You can use open router. But if you don't have any current subscriptions and you want to have something that's like price efficient and has the best models, then this could be your solution. Open code Zen. Now the best part about it is that there is no like markup, right? So whatever the model cost is like let's say you're using OpenAI models. Well, whatever that model costs in the API, that's how much you pay on the open code. Then open code doesn't charge you extra and it's usage based. So it's not like you pay $20 a month. You pay $20 and you get $20 worth of credits and you don't pay until you use those up. If you're paying for cloud code, you're most likely not using all your subscriptions, right? Like I I was paying for the $200 month cloud code and then I was never hitting the limit. So I downgraded to $100 a month and I'm still never hitting the limit, which means that I'm not using all the money I'm paying for. With Open Code Zen, that's not the case. You only pay when you use up those credits. And those credits are the actual price, not more expensive, no like extra markup. They also offer a model called Big Pickle, which is a fine version of GM 4.7. So that probably would have performed better than GM 4.7 open router. Actually, they also have Gro code fast one and Miniax M2.1 for free. So these models are free on Open Code Zen to attract users. Uh but they have other models as well. Let's dive into the fifth build idea. We're going to use Grock 4.1 fast for this. And the idea is a bit more complex. Probably the most complex out of these. Not technically, but like in terms of my vision for it and the features for it, right? So, it should be like a recursive narrus 4.5 for prompting. This could be useful for product photos for for personal photos in many different ways. We're going to test it as well. Let's get started. Yo, this codeex is crazy. Openi keeps opening that. Very annoying. Uh, OpenAI fixed that. I I don't know why it's opening five times when I'm like I'm going to uninstall Codex just for that. Like what is that? Boom. Going to use Grog 4.1 fast. Wait, is it code? Okay, I think it's better. I'm not sure which Grock which of these Grock models is the best at coding, but let's use the 4.1. Then we're going to do straight to build and going to do get to work and build this like a 10x engineer would. Also, Grock 4.1 fast should be fast. This should be the fastest app so far. Let's see if it nails it. Now, when you're using the GPD502 model, let's launch a new open code. So, I'm going to show you one disadvantage compared to Codex. So, let's open a codex, right? Like opens spamming this try if we go and you do the 5.2 CEX, which we can use as well again uh model and we can use the 5.2 the codex, but we cannot set the reasoning effort. Right? This is one thing that's really good about the codex extension, the ID extension from OpenAI is that you can select the reasoning effort. The issue with this, I think it's set to probably high. I don't think it's extra high. It's probably high. That is overkill for most problems. You want to stay to like medium for default or like low. High and extra high just man, this is like for the the deepest errors. Extra high can run for like 30 minutes. Even high can run for 15 minutes. So for most stuff you want to use medium. Here when you use it in open code you cannot set reasoning effort. So that's one advantage to using codex extension from openai. I'm trying to give you honest objective assessment of open code right. It has a lot of pluses but it has some minuses as well. These companies are always going to protect their native apps and tools, give them some benefits that are not available through the API so that others cannot uh build a better product at least in theory. Right? Obviously the the bonus of open code is that it's open source and it it uh lets anybody contribute. There's million there's literally millions of developers in the world who are contributing to open source projects and uh you really need to have a great engineering team if you're a closed source company to compete with that is finished or what's going on? Why did it stop? Why did you stop? This might be an issue with Grock 4.1. Like look at look at this task list. You know it wasn't done. It's on the third item of like 12. Yeah. So Grog 4.1 fast is nowhere near as good as Opus or Gemini 3. It's just not. Even though you'll see Xi team posting benchmarks and Elon posting benchmarks, uh the reality is it's not. You know, I don't know any person who's using this model actually to code. Everyone's using either Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 or GBT 5.2 Codex for bug fixes. These are the three best models right now. It's done as well. Continuing step by step to doist. This is very disappointing. Wow. While I'm switching back to Opus, I guess to finish this. Finish this. Also, I'm going to do one more thing. I have this Plexity D research, which gives it more info on how to use the API. I say info. Boom. In whatever above is more info about how to actually pass files to the Nanob Pro model on open router API. Make sure to follow this. Now, get to work and finish this app like a senior developer would. The fewer lines of code, the better. Boom. There we go. So, this deep research just uh I can show you the prompt. It's asking for how to properly pro inside of open API. How to pass images correctly. Answer the short perlexity deep research. Check 28 sources. that way. Uh I mean look these you know they have web search tools right open code as web search tool code as web search tool but they're not going to be as good as a deep research that checks 28 sources and uh yeah gives you a detailed answer. So when you're building with AI and you're getting stuck or you're doing something risky make sure to do a deep research and feed those results to your coding agent. This is one of the main things you have to do when being an effective AI coder. lot of a lot of you are not paying for any tool you know whether it's perplexity Gemini L JBD all of these have deep research you're not using it even if you are paying for it you're not really using deep research which is a huge mistake not just for coding but in general in life because a lot of you like to be practical you currently watching this are facing some problems whether it's your personal life your business whatever some of them some of those most of those are probably not coding related but you can still use the most powerful reasoning models and deep research to help you solve them in creative ways, figure out solutions that that you aren't aware of, stuff like that. But you probably aren't and that's why you're missing out. That's why only a few people really squeeze AI to the fullest and improve their life from it. Most people use CH GBT. They think they're good at it. They have the free plan. They don't know how to prompt it. It's terrible. So yeah, even like legit most people who think they're at the cutting edge of AI are nowhere near and they're completely clueless. Okay, let's see. It runs the build. Yeah. So, cloth opens 4.5 10 times better. I mean, probably like 50 times better, 100 times better than u gro 4.1 fast. I mean, it's not not even in the same league. So, don't don't listen to these benchmarks where Grock 4.1 fast beats Opus 4.5. It's just use it, okay? Use it for yourself and you'll see. Uh that's the main thing. the vibes test the in production test and like it's not an open code issue because with other models it didn't happen you know with Gemini didn't get stuck GPD 5.2 to codex didn't get stuck. Opus didn't get stuck. So we cannot give that L to open code. We have to give it to the model which was doc 4.1. All right. So we have the project structure. Let's see. This is how we need to run it. Copy. ENV local the example. We're going to copy that file again. Very nice. You just highlight it. It's already copied. Such a quality of life thing. So we need to give it to what? Open our API key. Let's do that. This one we have create API key. Let's say testing. Give it $10 limit. Boom. Again, do not share API keys with anybody. Treat them as passwords. So, we have the EMV local. Let's replace this. Save that. What do we have run def? That's it. Okay. So, clear and pm, right? Let's open the local host. Let's see if this actually works. Uh oh, error. We have errors. I'm going to screenshot. and I'm going to paste it in. We are running into a bunch of errors. The screenshot also I'm going to copy the whole terminal. Terminal. Boom. Paste that in terminal. Let me Lord of Super Whisper is kind of slow. Think harder and explain what exactly the issue is. We're running into a bunch of errors when the app opens and it goes into a wide screen. Give me a very simple and concise explanation. then implement a clean and minimal fix. I'm gonna do this. Boom. Plan mode to figure out what's going on. And again, in plan mode, it doesn't execute changes, but it's incentivized to read, learn about the codebase, to think harder. So, really learn to switch between plan and build. And these are really the only two modes. One thing about open code is that it removes all the clutter. It simplifies, right? You see all these different AI tools. They have like 10 different modes blah blah blah. Like all these extensions like there's so many coding extensions that have like seven different like architect debugging overwhelming, right? Open code is like simplified. That's that's the way to explain it. You have plan and build. That's it. Like what else do you need to do? You plan the change and you build it. You have a you have error, you plan how to solve it, then you solve it. Like so clean, man. There's no like even in claw there's that third default mode. What is that? I never used the default B in cloth code. So useless. And say yes. Execute. Issue app compiles. Fine. Conserus. I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Why is it asking? Oh, I switch back to plan. No. Use opus. What? What is going on? Okay, my my bad. So, I'm going to show you one thing. You can click on previous messages. Very good. So, I'm going to do revert under messages and file change. Just enter. And now we're in this. And now we're going to do build mode. I didn't switch the mode. That's my bad. But the the UI is very nice. Like you can all of this is highlightable. You can click on previous messages. And uh you know this popup, let me show you again the copy message to clickboard for create a new session. And you can search as well. Man, so nice. So nice. You might not see this as big thing, but like if you spent hours with these coding agents, these small updates really do add up. And why is it using the wrong model name? Oh my. Oh my, it's trolling me. I'm going to create the spec.md. Going to put it here is the original prompt. I'm going to say stop trolling. Read spec.md and use the exact same model slugs as in there. I'm going to do five exclamation exclamation points because again they have these models have a outdated context cut off and uh yeah see like it use 2.5 flash like that's not nana pro also the opus one it it tries to be sneaky tries to be sneaky here okay it did update opus that's good now tell me how to test the app again we have it started what am I It's already started. Boom. Reload. This is terrible UI. Okay. But the the front end is terrible. You can do a much better job than that. Keep it simple. Keep it minimal. Like a combination of Google Drive and Dropbox. We cannot We cannot do this. This in the big 26. Where's this front end? This is not 1992 website. What is this? I'm I'm going to screenshot it. Like this is embarrassing. We might need to do another open code with the Gemini 3. Fix our front. Okay. Wait. Let's Let's give shot. Give this guy a shot. Oh, okay. It's improving. It's improving. It's getting there. Okay. So, the UI has been redesigned apparently. Let's reload. Okay. Much better. Much better. Upload an image to start. Let's do some product photo. All right. So, we're going to take this iconic you are absolutely right mug. There we go. Oh, it works. Okay. All right. So, here we are. Look at this. We have the canvas. Now, we should be doing API call to opus. Look at this. So, it's the improvements. Natural lighting enhancement, cleaner background, dynamic angle, shut life. Yeah, let's do lure lighting enhancement. This looks like fake. Looks too inserted. Now, we're waiting for Nano Banana Pro to create the variations. Okay. Uh, we don't see them yet. This can take 10 to 20 30 seconds. Generating image is much slower generating text, but we didn't get the outcome. I don't know what happened. Oh, we have some 500 error, but it's progress. Again, this is the most feature complex app. So, I'm going to say uh logs. Paste it in. Logs. Switch to plan mode, by the way. We give it the screenshot so it has full context. Right now we have a strange Oh, why are we in Grog 4.1? What? We're running into an issue where everything works until the point where I select the variation I want to generate. Right? So the first agent, the prompting agent with Opus 4.5 correctly generates the variations. They get displayed in the UI. I can select the one I want. However, after that, we never get the output from the Narabara Pro. That's the issue. How we're passing the file to Nabara Pro. Maybe the file format is the issue. But yeah, there's there's definitely some issue. Also, I have a suspicion that is not following this deep research. So, I'm going to create a new file. Actually, I'm going to create a new folder named docs. And I'm going to move this and open it up. New file as well. I'm going to do uh open router files MD is just documentation so I can reference it. Make sure our code follows open router files. All right. Okay. So basically I'm tagging the file to remind it and I'll say think harder, explain what is likely happening and implement and prepare a stepbystep fix plan. Yeah. So it wasn't following the documentation. That's why it's very important that if something is essential, you create a markdown file inside of your codebase and you can tag it multiple times. I'm going to switch to Google say yes implement this so employ these free fixes we'll see honestly it's amazing watching these AI agents work like when you were looking at this in you know 2022 2023 nothing like this even existed but even last year early last year clo code still didn't exist wild now it works let's go you're absolutely right is generating variations how to improve this image what was But improved lighting. Yes, that's what's the worst about this image is like the inconsistent lighting. But does it generate the images? Okay. Oh, why did it reset the whole canvas? Oh, this is still going. Why is this still going? Oh, my bad. That's crazy. Open code just reset my session because uh yeah, whatever. Let's try again. Make sure no AI agents are running. What is going on? This should be like a recursive improvement of any image, right? So can use this for Shopify, e-commerce, for dating, whatever. Natural lighting enhancement. Let's see. Let's see. Can we get the nanob probe to work? We need to add more debugging if it doesn't work. But as you can see, like don't give up after first shot. You still need to upskill yourself if you want to build like very impressive apps, right? Most people are avoiding the pain of learning anything technical and that's why they're not getting the best results of AI coding. Yeah, you can oneshot most of simple apps, but you cannot oneshot like unique software that nobody has ever built before. You can see we're not getting the generation. Yeah, that's crazy. What's going on here? Let's do deep research. How to correctly can nano banana row accept the webb files? If so, how do this properly? Open router API or should we convert to PNG? Maybe this we're fighting an uphill battle here. Maybe it's easier to convert to PNG. Okay, it supports WPS input. Just going to add this to here. Boom. There we go. Are we fully following open router files plan mode? Okay. Yes, we are. But we still are getting errors. That's crazy. All right. Whatever. We have the new console logs. So, let's rerun that. I'm going to kill the server. Clear and npm around. It wants to delete the next folder. Uh, remember that next. Okay. So, I guess uh this one is an L. So, four wins, one L. Um, yeah, that's the accurate. I mean, I could spend 30 minutes on this and fix it, but I think it's safe to say that it didn't one-shot it for sure. And yeah, it didn't even finish it in like 30 minutes. So open code four wins 1 L in terms of building these apps. This was definitely most feature complex one but uh yeah 80% win rate is not bad and they have a very nice scaffold. Question is whether it's better at using opus and cloth code. It's very hard to say. I would say probably not because enthropic has knowledge of how cloud models work. But it will definitely be better at using other models than you just uh using them randomly in some chat app or direct API calls. Open code has a very nice environment that it puts the AI agents in. It has a nice interface. The prompts are optimized. Will I stop using cloth code? Probably not. But for other other models, I'll very likely use open code. So let me explain plan mode and build mode a bit more. I already went over it on surface level. But let me explain it deeper. Plan mode is read only. Yeah. Can analyze your codebase and create a strategy, but it cannot touch your files. It cannot make any changes. So, it's safe. You can talk to it. You can chat with it. It won't mess anything up. Build mode let the agent actually write, delete files, create files and stuff like that. And you can switch them with tab. So, not shift tab, just tab. There's also lots of quality of life features inside of open code. And this is why so many people are switching to it. Not just the fact that it's open source, not just the fact that it's free and that it, you know, offers so many different models. so many different providers. It's all the little stuff like this, the message actions. This is what impresses me the most. So, for example, the headings automatically summarize your pros. If you paste in a lot of stuff, you can see like it says 32 lines instead of making it actually long. Makes it easier to navigate. There's also to-do list. We look at that. And clicking messages gives you useful popup like this. We also looked at that. So, yeah, this has been open code. As you can see, it's a very capable, very powerful cloud code alternative, especially if you care about using open software and especially if you already have a subscription. As I mentioned, if you're already paying $20 a month for CHIGBT plus, you can use Open Code completely for free and it's a strong competitor to cloth code. So, yeah, there's a it's no secret why Open Code is blowing up over the last two three weeks because uh it is one of the most powerful coding agents out there. That being said, if you are serious about AI in 2026 and you want to use tools like Cloud Core, Open Code to build an actual business, I just made a full video about that on what is the best AI business model for 2026. Go watch it here.",
