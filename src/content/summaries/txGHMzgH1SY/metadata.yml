  What's really happening with prompt engineering for AI image generation? The common story is that natural language prompts are enough — but the reality is more complicated.

  In this video, I share the inside scoop on using JSON schemas to unlock precision with NanoBanana Pro:

  - Why JSON prompting works for high-stakes visual outputs
  - How structured schemas give you compositional control over scenes
  - What makes NanoBanana Pro a renderer instead of a vibes machine
  - Where JSON turns image generation into a reproducible, testable tool

  For builders and operators, learning to read pseudocode and structured inputs is becoming one of the most valuable skills for working effectively with LLMs.
