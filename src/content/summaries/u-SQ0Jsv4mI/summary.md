## Key Takeaways

Indy

Dev

Dan presents a comprehensive plan for engineers aiming to elevate their skills in agentic technology by 2026, emphasizing the critical role of trust in autonomous systems. He argues that foundational shifts in the AI model ecosystem open unprecedented opportunities for impact.

- **Anthropic as the Agentic Leader**: Top engineers should bet on Anthropic due to its consistent execution, engineer-focused tooling (like Claude Code), and its ecosystem of agent harnesses and sub-agents, providing the best foundation for building reliable agentic systems.

- **Tool Calling is the Untapped Opportunity**: Despite advanced models, only 15% of output tokens are tool calls. This represents the greatest opportunity for engineers to increase impact by designing agents that reliably execute longer, more complex chains of tools and actions.

- **Custom Agents Above All**: The most significant bet is on building custom agents tailored to solve specific problems. A well-crafted custom agent with minimal code and a precise system prompt can automate thousands of hours of manual work, directly correlating to increased trust and specialized problem-solving.

- **Scaling with Multi-Agent Orchestration and Sandboxes**: Moving beyond single agents, the next frontier involves orchestrating multiple specialized agents (e.g., lead agents delegating to worker agents) and running them in isolated **agent sandboxes**. This approach increases verification, allows for parallelization, and defers trust until results are validated, akin to staging environments.

- **Transition to Outloop Agentic Coding 2.0**: Engineers must progressively offload tasks to outloop agentic systems, minimizing the need for manual 'babysitting' (inloop). This evolution leads to **Agentic Coding 2.0**, where a lead agent orchestrates a team of specialized agents, abstracting complex workflows to simple prompts.

- **Focus on Practical Impact, Disregard Hype**: Public benchmarks are saturating, requiring engineers to build private evaluation systems for their specific use cases. Agents will increasingly become the primary interface, eating into traditional SaaS UIs. Crucially, engineers should ignore the **AGI/ASI hype** and focus on building practical, shippable solutions with current agentic capabilities.

## Summary

Indy

Dev

Dan's 2026 roadmap for becoming a top 2% agentic engineer is built around a central thesis: **"The Year of Trust."** He contends that the primary limitation for engineers is no longer the intelligence or speed of AI models, but rather their ability to trust agents with increasingly complex tasks. This trust directly translates to speed, iteration, and ultimately, impact. The video begins by highlighting the unprecedented capabilities of models like Gemini 3 Flash, which offers top-tier intelligence, speed (200 tokens/second), and multimodal input at a competitive price. This, along with other state-of-the-art releases like Opus 4.5 and GBG 5.2, signifies that the model ecosystem is intensely competitive, driving down the cost per intelligence token and enabling engineers to achieve more for less.

### Why Models Are No Longer the Limitation
Dan asserts that the abundance of powerful, affordable models means that models themselves are no longer the bottleneck. Instead, the focus shifts to how effectively engineers can leverage these models through agentic systems. He introduces "The Year of Trust" as the guiding principle for 2026: *Do you trust your agents?* This isn't a binary question but a spectrum—*how much* do you trust them? The more trust, the more work engineers can offload, leading to increased speed, iteration, and impact. This central thesis frames all subsequent predictions and recommendations for top engineers.

### Bet 1: Anthropic as an Agentic Leader
The first major bet is on **Anthropic becoming a monster** in the agentic space. Dan praises Anthropic's masterclass in execution, highlighting its focus on engineers. Products like Claude Code unlocked agentic coding for the masses, providing superior tool calling and a robust agent harness. Anthropic's consistent releases—from Sonnet 3.5 to Claude 4.5, including the Claude Code SDK and sub-agents—demonstrate a commitment to tooling beyond just the model. For top engineers, betting on Anthropic means building agents on the best foundation, reducing time spent fighting with tools and allowing more time for shipping innovative solutions.

### Bet 2 & 3: The Power of Tool Calling and Custom Agents
The second bet identifies **tool calling as the biggest opportunity**. Citing Open

Router data, Dan reveals that only 15% of all output tokens are tool calls. He argues this is incredibly low, as tool calls are a direct proxy for agents taking real, impactful actions. Engineers should aim to push their agents to call longer and longer chains of tools, directly increasing their total impact and trust in the system. This leads to the third bet: **Custom agents above all**. Dan claims a custom agent with just 50 lines of code, three tools, and a 150-line system prompt can completely automate massive problems. Custom agents solve custom problems, which unlock significant value. Learning to build these fine-tuned agents with SDKs (like Claude's Agent SDK) is the next step for engineers beyond using pre-built agentic coding tools. The ability to build an agent that reliably solves a problem extraordinarily well skyrockets trust.

### Bet 4 & 5: Scaling with Multi-Agent Orchestration and Sandboxes
While custom agents are powerful, they have limitations. The fourth bet is on **multi-agent orchestration**—the idea that one agent is not enough. This involves running multiple agents (3, 5, 10, or hundreds) to solve problems, a concept explored in his courses. More agents lead to more verification and increased trust through techniques like cross-validation. Sub-agents in the Claude ecosystem are an early example of this trend. As engineers scale their agent use, the question of *where* these agents run becomes critical. This brings up the fifth bet: **Agent sandboxes**. Top engineers will run their agents in isolated computing environments, much like dev boxes or staging environments. This allows agents to run rampant without risk to the primary system, deferring trust until the agent has proven its work. This "best of N" pattern enables parallelization, scaling, and isolation for both greenfield and brownfield codebases.

### Bet 6 & 7: Optimizing Workflows with Inloop/Outloop and Agentic Coding 2.0
Bet six distinguishes between **inloop and outloop agentic coding**. Inloop involves manually prompting and babysitting agents in a terminal, while outloop entails prompting through external systems (e.g., Slack, Git

Hub) and letting agents submit a PR or deliver a result autonomously. Top engineers will progressively offload more tasks to their outloop systems, maximizing hands-off automation and freeing up their time for critical inloop work. This progression leads to **Agentic Coding 2.0** (Bet seven): **agents that conduct agents**. This paradigm envisions a "command level" or "lead agent" that delegates, monitors, and coordinates specialized "worker agents." Engineers will interact with this lead agent, trusting it to manage the entire engineering team of sub-agents to plan, spawn, review, and ship work.

### Bet 8, 9 & 10: Evaluating, Interacting, and Focusing
Bet eight, **benchmark breakdown**, predicts that public benchmarks will become saturated and cease to provide meaningful signal as all models hit near-perfect scores. Top engineers will build **private evaluation systems** tailored to their specific use cases to accurately measure model performance and identify the best tools for their needs. Bet nine, **UIs versus agents**, posits that **agents will eat SaaS**. Many UIs will transform into prompt interfaces, with agents running behind the scenes to accomplish tasks more efficiently than traditional clickable interfaces. Top engineers will prioritize building minimal tooling to interact with services at light speed via agents, rather than relying on slow, database-driven UIs. The final bet, **AGI hype dies**, reflects Dan's strong stance against the marketing and vaporware surrounding Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). He believes top engineers will stop caring about these promises and instead focus intently on delivering maximum value with current, practical agentic capabilities.

### Bonus Bet: The Emergence of End-to-End Agentic Engineers
As a hidden eleventh bet for committed viewers, Dan predicts the emergence of the first **end-to-end agentic engineers**. These individuals will write blog posts showcasing complete systems built entirely by agents, from prompt to production, with no human in the loop or review. This represents the ultimate expression of trust in agentic systems and is framed as the endgame of agentic engineering: full autonomy.

### 2025 Predictions Review and Conclusion
The video concludes with a review of Dan's 2025 predictions, noting a high accuracy rate (13 out of 15 bets correct). He correctly predicted the standardization of AI coding, the beginning of agentic coding (driven by Claude Code), the decline in code cost, a "skill gap earthquake" with fewer entry-level roles, and the non-existence of an "LLM wall." He admits getting the "year of infinite memory" wrong, acknowledging that effective context windows improved but true memory remains a challenge. He also missed that OpenAI would remain number one, with Gemini 3 Flash and Opus 5 now leading. His 2025 predictions underscore the rapid pace of AI evolution and his consistent foresight.
