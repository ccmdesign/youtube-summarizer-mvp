  "fullText": "People are really hating Windows 11. Ever since October 14, 2025, the end of support deadline for Windows 10, Microsoft has made a lot of their users very angry. Microsoft's Windows 11 is facing a significant adoption crisis. Recent data shows adoption rates for Windows 11 are at only 31% as users are resisting to update their operating systems. And a primary driver for this resistance is the TPM 2.0 requirement. This is a mandate to enable the trusted platform module version 2.0, O which has made millions of functional PCs from 2018 and 2019 completely obsolete leaving approximately 400 million users on unsupported hardware. Users are so frustrated with this change that they are now migrating away from Windows and switching to Linux which has seen its desktop usage increased by nearly 5%. Another issue that is angering users is the mandatory Microsoft account integration. The removal of local account options and forced one drive syncing is viewed as a step towards a never-ending subscription model. And then there's the new recall feature. Security researchers warned that this AI feature, which screenshots your activity at certain time periods, is a massive vulnerability for data theft. And lastly, performance benchmarks indicate that Windows 11 can be measurably slower than Windows 10 in some cases. So, needless to say, users are not very happy with the direction Microsoft is heading. If you want to hear more tech stories like this, be sure to subscribe to the Better Stack",
