  "fullText": "Today I want to share a bit about something I've been playing around with for the last few days and this is skills the open AI agent ecosystem. This is the skills.sh. This is from Versel and basically uh if you don't know what skills is, this is a way you can kind of level up your AI agents. So if you look at the Claude codes interpretation of this, this is extend Claude with skills. create, manage, and share skills to extend cloud's capabilities include code includes custom slash commands and stuff like that. So, basically, it's a simple way to upgrade uh your agents for whatever use case you have. So, you can think of it like it's like in between like an MCP server, but it's a bit more different. I'm not going to go into kind of exactly how skills work in this video. I'm just going to showcase the new marketplace or ecosystem from Versel here. So if you scroll down a bit, you can see here are kind of where we can download or reuse other people's skills they have created. So you can see versel react best practices. This is the most installed for this is a bit more based on kind of the front end part. So you can see we have web design guidelines 18,000 downloads. Then we have remotion. We're going to try that out. So basically what I want to do, I want to try to update my web page using these two skills from Versel here. And I want to try some simple video editing with remote skill. So basically you can see all we have to do install in one command npx skills add and just uh yeah the repo here. So let's try it out and see what this can do for us. Uh and like I said I will be using cloud code for this. Okay so this is kind of my code base for this website now. Right. So we have the NPC my creative uh agents video agents website. You can see it's looked pretty good, but I kind of want to make maybe add some dark mode, maybe some smoother animations. We'll see what we can do. So, you can see now we're just going to head back here. And, you know, uh, we need this MPC skills command. So, I'm just going to Yeah. Can we see if I click on this, right? I guess we can do that. And you can see we can just copy this here, right? Install. And if I go to cloud code now, you can see I launched this in my web page. And I'm just going to paste in run this command. And I think we want to install two of these. Yeah, we want to install this, right? So this is super easy. But remember, we also want to along with the best practices, we also want to install the web interface guidelines. So I'm also going to copy this command. I'm going to head back to cloud code. But first let's finish installing this. Uh here you can see we can see the skills and we got that. Okay. So we installed those and next is going to be the the web design guidelines skills. Okay. That was done. So I think we need to restart claw code now. So I'm just going to exit clear and I'm going to do claw again. Go into this. So if we do slash skills now you can see we have those two skills. Burcell react best practices, web design guidelines. This is project based skills. So this is not global and that's what I wanted. Right? So now that we have these skills, uh I want to make a prompt to actually take use of these skills. So if we go back to cursor now, you can now see we have something called claude here and we have skills and here we can see we have versel and we have the web design. So we click on versel, we go to skills.md. Here we kind of have the full overview. Let me just close this of what we are looking at here. So you can see we have a bunch of information. Claude can look up here. Rendering performance, JavaScript performance. We can switch over to web design skill.md. And again uh yeah it kind of refers to this file here. So this is a file we can fetch fetch press fresh guidelines before each review. Something we can do right. So this is kind of the way uh when we do this MPX install or skills, we get this into our cloud skills and we can kind of refer to this here. So yeah, works pretty smooth. So remember the skills we kind of upgraded this agents to now is kind of to follow the best practices and the web design guidelines from Versel. So I'm just going to say I already have a working Versel stack page. Uh explore the codebase. Please use best practices to update this page. Also, I want the page to have a dark team option and some smooth animations. So, when I click enter now, hopefully we can see that uh Claude code or this agent now decides to use some of the skills we already have uh yeah kind of installed here. But you can see first it's going to explore the code base and then I'm going to take you back if I see Claude code choosing here to use some of the skills we kind of have upgraded this agent to. Okay. So you can see now it kind of loaded up a couple of skills. So this is the versel react best practices web design guidelines and now it's going to yeah let me see what happens. So it's going to read this agents.mmd file. We're going to fetch something here. So we can look at some web interface guidelines from versel labs. Okay that's fine. command.md. So I'm just going to let this run and see what kind of how we're going to use these skills and how this is going to be implemented into our web page here. So you can see now it's kind of working on the dark team. Uh it's going to look at some uh preers reduced motion. Okay. So basically hopefully now it's just going to look at the page we have do some updated or upgrades based on kind of the skills we gave it and then we're going to see how this look afterwards. So you can see after kind of running the review here of the full page based on kind of the guidelines from the skills we have some issues here we can try to fix. So on line 7 37 15. Yeah, we can try to see its navigation accessibility interaction. Yeah, you kind of get the point. This is kind of what this skill is about. And now you can see cloud code is working on these issues kind of based on the guidelines from the skill package we installed. So yeah, uh I think we are done with the dark mode and now we're just going to do this and let's take a look at the final result. So yeah, we have updated all the pages for dark mode. Now, let's just go here and let's start the page again. So, mpm rundev and we're going to open up this in an external browser. And let's see. Now, we should have the dark mode, right? All right. This looks pretty good. And yeah, animations feels pretty smooth like they did before. I don't see any big changes, but uh I like the dark mode. Let's try to switch to light. Okay, seems to work pretty good. So, is this persistence now? If you go to pricing, yeah, that kind of brings the dark mode over. What about the blog page? Good. Signin page. Yeah, still dark mode. And what if we switch? All right, so that was pretty easy. Did this make like a big change? I'm not quite sure, but uh we at least got the dark mode working and it's looking pretty smooth. So, of course, I would have follow up with do this on mobile and stuff like that, but uh I'm not going to skip that now. And yeah, like a super easy way to kind of get sure or make sure that uh if you wanted to, you kind of have all the Versel React best practices. Of course, this is very specific to this stack. And we have some web design guidelines that can also be nice to follow if you're building on Versel like most of my projects are. But now I want to move on to Remotion. So Remotion is kind of a way you can edit videos by using code. And this is something I really like to do. So I'm kind of excited to see what we can actually do with reotion and cloud code and using code to animate and edit video. Okay. So what I have done now is uh I went into remotion right. I installed this uh MPX skills here and you can see here are kind of all the markdown files. So these are the rules, calculations, everything we need to kind of use remote in the best practices. So these are kind of referring to different market files. So if we go to cursor now and we go under cloud skills remote best practices what we installed and we look at the skill MD file you can see these are kind of referring to all of these different uh pages so Claude can fetch so this could be rules for 3D assets fonts everything here right so that's pretty good so what I want to do now is I have two different clips the first clip is basically me just talking about yeah I'm not going to play the audio now but this me just talking about the intro for this video for example 12 seconds and I have like some B-roll something like that this is just me scrolling over this skill page so I want to try to use remote now to kind of edit this video add some cool transitions maybe some animations some captions and see how that goes so uh what I'm going to do is I headed over to cloud code in this directory and now I want to start trying to edit this videos using every motion. Okay, so I think I have a plan now. I'm going to read this but you can skip ahead. So basically what we want to do, we have the two clips shills 1.mpp4 and b-rollmp mp4. The video is about a intro to skills uh to understand the clips. We want to use ffmpeg to get the audio to mp3. Then we want to use a local whisper model to get the SRT file. This is the transcription and the timestamps. And when you have this, you can find the best place to insert a B-roll clip and also add captions to the video and some smooth animations. Create a plan for this. So, I'm going to go to plan mode and create a plan for how we're going to execute all of these tasks. So, hopefully now Claude can uh in like with Remotion and FFmpeg and Whisper fully edit my video. So, I have it ready with all the animations, captions, everything we need in kind of one go. So I'm going to take you back when we have the plan and then see if we can actually execute on this plan. So we can see now uh Claude is actually using the skills here. So it's looking at remotion best practices, rules, videos, animations, audio, and I found some important best practices from the skills. Let me update the plan to correct the remote patterns. All of this looks pretty good. So this kind of could save us some time. if we kind of have the all the skills are updated and the documentation is updated. This will kind of help us saving some time and maybe get some better results. So, I think the plan is almost ready now after we kind of looked at the last set of skills we learned and see if we can actually edit this video. So, I'm just going to accept this plan now. And hopefully now Claude is just going to start working on this task we gave it. And I'm not going to touch anything. I'm not going to do any interventions now. I'm just want to see if the plan if this plan works first time and hopefully we get a good results with the B-roll added on top of our foot uh footage and some captions and some animations. Okay, so here comes the exciting part now. So you can see we should be ready to test this. So I'm just going to say run uh mpm uh rundev for me. And hopefully now we have like a fully edited video only done with whisper ffmpeg and reotion used by cloud code. Okay, so you can see we popped up into their editor and right away this looks pretty good. You can see we have the captions. So let me uh turn off my mic and let's play the 12 second clip. Today we are taking a look at versel skills.sh. This is where you can kind of upgrade or level up your agents like cloud code. So let's take a look at it and see how we can actually use this in practice. Today we are taking a look at versel skills dot. Okay, that wasn't too bad, right? We kind of you can see I'm going to turn off the sound here. So we we got the captions. They look fine. We could have done some more editing on those if we wanted to. And you can see at 8 seconds or something, we switch to the B-roll. And I guess that's fine. Maybe we could have done that earlier. Maybe we can done it at 2 seconds. But uh other than that, that looks pretty good. And I think there's much more we could do with this. So let's uh ask for some more uh engaging or attention editing just to see what happens. So I'm just going to say great job. We need the editing to be more engaging, more to keep the people's attention. Do your best. So, I'm I'm going to leave it like with an open-ended goal and let's see what kind of editing here now uh Claude Code can do with the remote skills and stuff like that and see if we can make it a bit more interesting. So, I went ahead I asked Claude if they can do some uh sound effects. So, it suggested I should go ahead and create all of these sound effects. So, I did that. Uh I just put them in this audio here audio folder. So, now we have the six sound effects. So, I'm just going to refer to that and let's see if it can add it. I just added all the effects in audio and now I want to see if it adds all these effects into the final clip. So, I'm going to render the clip and then we're going to play it to see if it's more engaging that what we had the first time around. So, I just said here render the clip save to CVD and now we are kind of rendering. You can see here we are rendering the clip and this should be saved and then we're going to open it and let's play it in kind of full to see uh yeah like I said is this more engaging and would I ever use this in some video editing. Okay, so you can see this is now rendered. So let's open this up now. So uh you can see it's stored here. Skills intromp here and let's watch the full clip. Today we are taking a look at versel skills.sh. This is where you can kind of upgrade or level up your agents like cloud code. So let's take a look at it and see how we can actually use this in practice. Yeah, that was not maybe perfect. Uh but I think there are something here. So I'm definitely going to explore this more. How I can use claw uh code with remotion and the skills package to kind of edit videos. Definitely going to explore it more. So yeah, I think that was pretty much it I wanted to cover today. So go check it out. skills.sh. I think it's pretty interesting and I think we're going to see more of these agent marketplaces popping up in 2026. So yeah, thank you for tuning in. Have a great day and I'll see you again",
