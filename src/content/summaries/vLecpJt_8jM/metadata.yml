title: "Anthropic's Latest Move: Why OpenCode Users Are Worried"
description: >-
  Anthropic's recent decision to restrict Claude API access to third party tools
  using their subscription has left OpenCode users scrambling. If you're paying
  for a Claude subscription hoping to power OpenCode or similar CLI assistants,
  you're out of luck. Anthropic has effectively killed third-party terminal
  integrations. In this video, I break down exactly what changed, why Anthropic
  made this move, and most importantly, what it means for the future of AI
  coding tools. This is the wake-up call every OpenCode user needs.
