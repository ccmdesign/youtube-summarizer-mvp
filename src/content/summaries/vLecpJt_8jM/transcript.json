  "fullText": "It looks like Anthropic are clamping down on other coding agents using their subscription. So, Open Code, Claudebot, and many others. Meaning, if you have a Claude Pro or Max plan, you can only use it with Claude Code and nothing else. But this seems to have had the biggest impact on Open Code users since it's probably the most popular terminal coding agent after Claus Code. Do Anthropic really see them as a threat? Hit subscribe and let's get into it. If you've never heard of Open Code, it's an insanely popular terminal coding tool, which you can learn more about in this video, but basically it's made by the same company behind SST, so Anomaly, and it's an open-source agent that can be used with any model. So any Claude, any OpenAI model, Gemini, any of the Chinese models, you name it, you can use it with open code. And most importantly, it also supports a bunch of subscriptions. In fact, I think it might have been the first tool to actually support the Claude subscription other than Claude Code. So, you can run Open Code or login, sign in, and benefit from the subsidized costs that the subscription provides. Don't hold me to this, but I think this might have helped make Open Code so popular. I mean, it's been out for less than a year and has more than 56 K stars on GitHub and almost 150,000 weekly downloads on npm alone. And there are multiple ways to download it. So, I'm sure those stats are really high as well. But what makes this worse for Anthropic is that it seems like on Twitter anyway, that people actually prefer using open code with clawed models than using clawed code. And the business side of Anthropic must have been furious at hearing this news. I mean, they have a subsidized subscription plan and people are using it with whatever tool they want. This is not the best way to lock them into the ecosystem. So, they made this decision. Luckily, Open Code have found a way around this, which I'll talk about later on in the video. But to be honest, this decision makes perfect business sense. There are users out there who run claude models for 24 hours every single day, which would rack up thousands of dollars in API costs. And this is even before the Ralph loop technique became popular because now people are using it to run loops over and over again to slowly improve their project. You can learn more about Ralph from this video. I'll also link it in the description. But essentially, Anthropic are taking a huge hit from users that aren't in their ecosystem. It's kind of like Spotify allowing you to use their subscription with Apple Music or Amazon Music. It just doesn't make business sense. What does make more sense is if a user is locked into Claude Code and they use its features for their workflows like hooks, sub aents, and skills. Then if a newer model comes along from a different company like OpenAI or Gemini, they're less likely to move from Claude to it because they're so used to the systems they've put in place from Claude's code. But with open code allowing users to use their claude subscription that prevents anthropic from having that lockin because with open code you can use any model and open code has its own features like agents skills and sub aents. So you could have a workflow in open code and if a newer model say Grock comes out you can just switch that workflow to grock and as a user you don't have that lock in from anthropic which is good because you can choose the best and cheapest model for your task but it's bad for anthropic because they make much less money. So, I completely understand why Anthropic are doing this. But what I don't understand is why they did it so suddenly, kind of overnight. No blog post, no warning, no nothing, leaving their users bewildered. But luckily, Open Code has a fix for this issue, which you can see in this PR. Simply by prefixing tool names with OCore in outgoing requests. Well, I say simply, it must have taken a while for DAX to figure this out. And by also stripping that prefix from tool names in the streaming response. I'll have a link to the PR in the description if you're interested. But this fix is just temporary. I'm 100% certain Anthropic will find a way around this. They'll find some kind of key or some technique to prevent users from doing this, patch it in to their API, and this will happen again and again until the Claude subscription is not used in any other tools apart from clawed code because it makes business sense. So what does this mean? If you're an Open Code user who heavily uses Opus 4.5, does that mean you have to move all your workflows, all your agents, your skills to clause code? Not exactly. The Open Code team have been working on something called Open Code Black, which is a $200 a month subscription that lets you use any models. At this time, we're not sure the exact models or the limits they impose. But this could be a great alternative if you were on the $200 Max Claude plan. Until then, I'll stick with open code, use clawed models, do the subscription for as long as I can, but then move to API pricing and use them a lot less in favor of other models. I really like using the open code 2y and I can't imagine moving all of that to clawed code. But if you want an update on this overall situation, be sure to hit subscribe, which also helps us to get one step closer to hitting a 100K subscribers.",
