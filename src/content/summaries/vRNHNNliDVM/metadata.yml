title: The SECRET to Stunning AI Video Prompts!
description: >-
  Is it possible to get consistent, Hollywood-level cinematography from AI video
  generators? Yes, but you need the right workflow.


  In this video, I’m sharing my Ultimate AI Prompt Workflow for cinematic
  filmmaking. We aren't just typing text into a box and hoping for the best; we
  are building a "Murder Board" system that takes you from a static Midjourney
  image to a fully realized, cinematic shot using Nano Banana Pro, Kling 2.6,
  and LLMs.


  I’ll show you how to structure the ultimate prompt template, the crucial 21:9
  aspect ratio hack, and my favorite discovery: using ShotDeck to extract real
  movie metadata—including lens types, camera specs, and color hex codes—to
  force the AI to respect your cinematic vision.


  If you are tired of random results and want to master the ultimate workflow
  for AI video, this is the tutorial you’ve been waiting for.
