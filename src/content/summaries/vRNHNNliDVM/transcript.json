  "fullText": "So, one of the things that I love about AI film making and video is how rapidly it's evolving. But that also means that we're constantly, you know, having to shift and update our workflows. And because it's such a general technology, I mean, there are hundreds of different approaches and use cases. So, today we're going to walk through one of them in my opinion, kind of the latest and greatest, definitely the one that provides you with the most cinematic outputs. Plus, I've got a reference in this video that you are definitely going to want to bookmark. It is, dare I say, a gamecher for your prompts. So, kicking off at the top, this method is building off something that I talked about in last week's newsletter. Oh, you didn't know there was a newsletter? Well, that's fair because there's only been one issue so far. We'll talk more about it later, but if you want to sign up for it, the link is down below. Anyhow, in the pro tip section of the inaugural newsletter, I went over friend of the channel PJ A's Legend of Zelda trailer workflow. We're going to use this as a base template, but of course I, you know, I added some spices to it. I think that's important to note, like I'm not Columbusing anything here. We're all building off of each other's work and discoveries. Learn something, tweak it, share it. There's no point in hoarding information because, well, frankly, a year from now, even this method is going to be outdated. The next important thing before we fully dive in, there are, of course, a few ingredients that we're using here. The main big one being Nano Banana Pro. This is a wholly imagetovideo workflow. And finally, I'm going to be presenting this whole thing over on Flora. You don't have to use Flora. You can use anything that you want to accomplish this. I'm just using Flora for well, three reasons. One, I like it. Two, I had a bunch of credits there. And three, well, I mean, it is the murder board, which look, I know not all of you love the nodebased murder boards, but in this case, I actually think it really works well to visually show you the workflow. To be clear, this video is not sponsored by Flora. In fact, they don't even know that I'm making this. So, I say what I want. So, moving on to the main course. You guys know that I like to put together a little proof of concepts for these tutorials. Uh, so let's go check in with Captain Renfield in his latest adventure on the high seas. >> Man, the cannons. WE'RE GOING TO DIE. FOLLOW THE ORDERS. It's too late, [music] Captain. The ship [music] is going down. >> [music] >> You know, if there's one thing we've learned, if you board a boat and Captain Renfield is at the helm, you should probably get back to land. What's kind of crazy is that this whole thing just begins with two images. Uh, of course, a reference image of Captain Renfield, uh, and then the deck of a pirate ship that was generated up in midjourney. It's not even really that great an image in all honesty. Uh from there, and again, don't get lost in the murder board of all of this. It's just a really good way to visually showcase everything. We're taking both of these two images and then going over to a node here that is really just chat GPT 5.2. You can use Gemini. Uh you can use Claude, you can use pretty much any uh LLM that you want. From there, we have a pretty significant template prompt that we provide to the LLM. Uh this is page one. This is page two. Uh, you can screenshot and OCR this if you want, but I will also provide it in this week's newsletter, making it easy for you to copy and paste. Yeah, you see what I did there? Can't even get mad at me cuz I know that you know, and you know that I know. Now, what's kind of cool about this format is that it actually has a top header section where you describe what is happening, like what the scenario is, and then from there, uh, the LLM will figure out, you know, essentially how to populate that prompt. And despite, you know, the kind of massive amount of information that this thing is trying to pack in, it's actually built to output um, you know, prompts around 2,800 characters, what I've discovered, particularly with Nano Banana Pro, when you start bumping up that character or token limit, well, that's where you start running into problems. We'll take a look at that a little later on. So, now that we have our LLM buddy essentially filling in our crazy long prompts and to note, uh, because each one of these frames actually has its own description in it, you can go through and change them if you want to. Uh obviously from there we just plug that along with our reference images that is very important uh over to Nano Banana. Now one of the things that I think uh makes this extra cinematic is by utilizing Nano Banana Pro in a 21x9 format. Uh for some reason this is mostly available via API. For whatever reason even on Flow which is Google's filmmaking platform uh we're still limited to 16x9. That said you can generally find a 219 option on any of the majors. Obviously here on Flora over on Freepick, Leonardo has it, Recraft has it. Um, so yeah, basically like anywhere outside of Google, you have a native 219 option. From here, I think most of you know the drill. It's just, you know, r-rolling and tweaking your prompt a bunch. Uh, I will note Captain Renfield in particular is always a bit problematic for me. Nano Banana always wants to turn him into Jack Sparrow or occasionally, weirdly, Tom Hardy. Admittedly, Renfield is a bit of a stock character. I mean, not to me, but uh you know, anytime that you plug him into an image generator or editor, uh the second it pirate, it's like, oh, you mean Jack Sparrow, Captain of the Black Pearl. But that does seem to be a bit of a specific pirate problem. Like, I don't run into this with Flamethrower Girl, who, yes, we will see later on in this video. Moving back to our main project page, you will note that there is no connecting line between our 2x two generations and our next step. Um, it's actually kind of one of the reasons that I really like working this Murderboard fashion. Um, yeah, there is no connector here because what we need to do here is crop each one of our shots. Now, technically, I guess you could do this in Nano Banana. But to me, it feels like a bit of a waste of credits. I mean, the easiest thing to do is just, you know, just crop it. Just take it over to, you know, whatever image traditional image editor uh you use and just, you know, crop it and then save it out again. Once we have our cropped image, and you may find this part optional, but a good practice is to take uh that image and then just run it back through nano banana again with a like an image enhancement prompt because we initially began in that 2x two grid and we're essentially cropping that out. I mean, the image comes in a little bit on the mushy side. So, by running this prompt, this is actually PJ's original prompt. I didn't tweak it or mess with it cuz it works pretty well. We end up with this as an output. And if you kind of AB the two of them, yeah, for sure the prompt does have an effect. Once we have our slightly cleaned up image, uh it's back over to another LLM, uh with a template that I built out. So, once again, here is the prompt template. You can feel free to screenshot it or uh once again, it'll be in the newsletter this week. Uh again, the important part here is that we do have a user input section where we can describe what action we want to have taken and then additionally dialogue as well if the video model supports dialogue. From there, you take that output prompt and bring it into well, I mean, to be honest, any video generator that you want. I've been using Cling 2.6 a lot more lately. Um, I think it's a very good um has a lot of great motion. And interestingly, I although not officially outputting at 219, if you give it a 21x9 image, it will respect that aspect ratio. I do feel the need to point out that no matter how tight your prompt template is or how tight your prompt is, like it's still image to video. You're still going to get some like weird wonky results. Uh, for example, here's three shots that I put together for like a quick flamethrower girl example. And our middle shot where I just wanted her to smile at the thought of the oncoming battle. Well, I mean, she goes like full-on Hulk mode here. That said, tweaking the prompt and a couple of rerolls, well, we ended up with this. Yeah, you never want to be on the business end of that flamethrower. Now, for some other jazz that we can throw on top of all of this, including uh some homebrew camera selection and a really killer resource for you. Uh, and I should point out when I say homebrew camera selection, I mean, we kind of are talking about like the Higsfield Cinema Studio thing. And look, to be clear, I'm not taking shots at it at all. In fact, I actually think it's a pretty cool and smart feature, but I'm also like 99% sure that this is, you know, it's a very nice and pretty interface that essentially is triggering a Nano Banana prompt. Again, not taking anything away from it. I actually think it's a pretty smart feature, but do keep in mind that Nano Banana Pro or really any image generator isn't giving you a like full accurate representation of the lens, camera, f-stops, etc. Uh, these are just key words that are getting you into the ballpark. For example, friend of the channel is Gio gives us this image which was prompted with the presets of an AR Alexa 35 millimeter, a Hawk 5 uh anamorphic lens uh 50 mm. Now, it just so happens that he's actually used that exact same setup and this is a screenshot from well the the real version of that rig. And again, not that there's like anything necessarily wrong about uh the generated output. So again, what this really is is more of a ballpark than anything. Uh, you know, the plus side is that once you understand that conceptually, you can go into even more obscure or personalized directions if you want. For example, revisiting our initial base 2x two prompt with flamethrower girl and well, this midjourney generated hanger bay, uh, we end up with this. And again, this is just the base template. Um, I did cut it together. So, let's take a quick look at the 8 seconds that I got out of three of these shots. So now, if we wanted to get a little bit of that Cinema Studio spank, all we have to do is really add some keywords to the top of our prompt. Uh, in this case, we're going with a Panovision Millennium DXL2 with a Zeiss Prime lens at 14 mm at 1.4 uh, f-stops or T-tops, I guess. Um, and as we can see, I mean, yeah, there is definitely a difference between our base prompt and this. Um, it definitely gets that 14mm look here. Kind of loses it in some other spots. Um, f1.4, sure, maybe. I mean, you know, again, ballpark. Swapping out for an IMAX camera with once again the Hawk 5 anamorphic lens. Uh, this time at f11. Yeah, I mean, I think it definitely does show that it it it's listening. It's making a difference. The framing here is different. It definitely looks more much more like like IMAX framing. What's great about doing it manually and not with the preset is well, I mean, you can do anything. for example, like an early 2000's Sony VFX1000 uh DV cam with a fisheye. This is the uh skater video weapon of choice. Uh and as you can see, we're still getting everything uh that all of the action that's supposed to be occurring within the prompt. Just kind of looks like it was captured again on a VFX 1000 with the fisheye lens. But here is where we're going to kick things up a notch with one of the coolest resources I've run across. This one comes to us via a channel called Flesh Syntax. I don't I don't know the the origin or the meaning of that name. Uh I just think it's kind of cool. Sounds very like Croninburgian. Uh anyhow, he ended up doing a review on Higsfield. It is a great video. I'll have it linked down below. And in that video, well, he introduced me to a site called Shot Deck. And oh man, it's great. So, this is a crazy packed resource of technical information on like thousands of films and like hundreds of shots in those films. So, uh this is well, this is from Sinners, but if you click into any shot, man, is it packed with information. I mean everything from the film stock, the lens, the camera, um frame size, shot type. I mean like again I mean you can read it's all there. Um so yeah, really really great resource and again kind of a ridiculous amount of titles. Uh again we're only up to we'll see here. I mean it just keeps going. Now I do want to point out I am not affiliated with Shot Deck at all. There is subscription pricing here. That said uh apparently there's also a free twoe trial. No credit card required which is what I did. Um so yeah I mean take that as you will. So, what can we do with this shot deck information? Well, initially my thought was like just grabbing a screenshot of the open the pod bay doors howl scene from 2001. Uh, just to plug it directly into like the prompt and the and Nano Banana and let it rip. Unfortunately, it didn't really pick up too much. Again, this is what I was talking about early in the video with essentially like context overloading Nano Banana. slightly better results utilizing the information for this shot from Andor, but as you can see the nano banana output, I mean, well, it's not a, it's not really following directions, and b, I mean, it kind of looks a bit on the bland side. The trick I found that does seem to work is take that shot information and then just have an LLM extract all of the information along with the color hex codes of that uh, particular shot and then just add that into your prompt. So, here's where you can really see the difference. On the bottom we have our base 2 by two prompt and then above it our andorized version of it. Um and in that version we are still getting all of the things that we asked for in our prompt. Um it's just that we're getting a lot more especially uh the color palette has been applied in here. So yeah, um definitely a very handy trick here if you're feeling particularly experimental or want to get creative with it. I mean there's like a ton of stuff that you can do here. Uh, I did give it like the Wes Anderson. It's Asteroid City. Um, it's a bit of a cheat there. I mean, anytime that you do Wes Anderson, it's gonna come out very Wes Andersony, but um yeah, I mean I this kind of made me chuckle. I'm not going to [snorts] say it's necessarily perfect. In fact, actually taking this shot from Bullet Train and applying that, we ended up with this, which um I mean it looks like it's trying to do the job. It's just also a bit of a mess. But if you lean into it, you can end up with some pretty interesting and wacky stuff. Uh, for example, taking this shot from Point Blank, the Lee Marvin crime revenge film, we end up with these shots, which uh, to be honest, I mean, I kind of love or by taking this shot from the Richard Donner version of Superman and applying that, we end up with this, which really surprised me. Uh, and I also kind of absolutely love, again, a lot of that is more on the experimental side, but hey, I mean, experimental is how we develop new workflows. So, yeah, if you've got any questions or comments, please drop them down below. And again, please do sign up for the newsletter. The prompts will go out in the next issue. Uh the plan there is to have the newsletter really serve as a supplement to the channel. So if you do like these videos, uh chances are you will be happy with the inbox notification. In the meantime, I thank you for watching. My name is Tim.",
