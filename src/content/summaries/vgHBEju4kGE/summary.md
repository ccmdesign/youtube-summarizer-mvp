  title: "Claude Code 'Interview' Mode in 6 Minutes"
  description: "Effortless Project Planning: Mastering Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code


    Kick off the new year with a fresh approach to project planning using Claude Code! In this video, learn how to achieve better project outcomes by focusing on a spec-driven development process. Inspired by Tariq from Claude Code, this method emphasizes slowing down to speed up by having Claude interview you before diving into coding. Discover how the 'Ask User Question' tool can lead to more detailed and well-thought-out specifications, ultimately saving you time and improving your code quality. Perfect for developers tackling large features, this video reveals the power of an interview-first, spec-second, code-last approach.

Claude Code is Anthropic’s command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for agentic coding. While its primary use is writing and refactoring code, the "Interview" mode is a specialized setting focused on knowledge transfer, architectural understanding, and professional development.

**Core Functionality and Purpose**
In standard mode, Claude Code focuses on executing tasks (fixing bugs, adding features). In Interview mode, the relationship shifts: the AI becomes a collaborative reviewer or a mock interviewer. It analyzes the local repository to challenge the developer’s understanding of the system design, specific logic choices, and potential edge cases.

**Key Features and Use Cases**
*   **Onboarding and Context Deep-Dives:** When entering a new or complex codebase, developers can use Interview mode to have the AI quiz them on how components interact. This ensures the developer isn't just "copy-pasting" but actually comprehending the underlying architecture.
*   **Mock Technical Interviews:** The tool can simulate a technical interview environment. By referencing the actual files in the project, it asks questions similar to those a Senior Engineer or Architect would ask during a system design or "deep dive" interview session.
*   **Code Review Preparation:** Before submitting a Pull Request, a developer can use this mode to identify "code smells" or weak points in their logic. Claude identifies areas where the developer might struggle to justify their implementation and forces them to articulate their reasoning.
*   **Proactive Questioning:** Unlike standard LLM interactions where the user asks all the questions, Interview mode allows Claude to take the lead. It identifies critical paths in the code and asks, "Why was this specific library used here?" or "How does this function handle concurrent requests?"

**Actionable Takeaways**
*   **Activation:** The mode is typically accessed via specific CLI flags or commands within the Claude Code environment (e.g., instructing the agent to "switch to interview mode").
*   **Interactive Learning:** Use this mode for "Rubber Ducking" on steroids. Instead of talking to a silent object, you are talking to an agent that understands your entire file structure and can push back on your explanations.
*   **Skill Refinement:** For engineers preparing for job loops, this tool provides a low-stakes environment to practice explaining complex technical decisions verbally and logically, using real-world code rather than abstract LeetCode puzzles.

**Conclusion**
Claude Code’s Interview mode bridges the gap between doing the work and understanding the work. It is an essential tool for developers who want to improve their technical communication and for teams looking to standardize code quality through more rigorous self-review processes.
