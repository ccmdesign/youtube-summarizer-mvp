title: The Biggest Battle in AI is for Your Personal Context
description: >-
  The AI race centers on the battle for personal context. Google Gemini's
  Personal Intelligence links Gmail, Photos, Search and YouTube to deliver
  tailored, privacy‑focused recommendations via opt‑in connectors. Anthropic's
  Claude Cowork and Claude Code surface desktop context and connectors while
  OpenAI, Apple and additional companies build memory, app ecosystems, hardware
  and health connectors as competing strategies.
