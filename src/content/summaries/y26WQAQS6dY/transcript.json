  "fullText": "All right, now we get into something that's both a skill and a general mindset shift in how we approach our work. I call it workflow orchestration, and it's about developing your intuition and your feel for knowing which tool to reach for in every situation. And this involves keeping an understanding of what actually drives your personal workflow and knowing the tools that you have available to you. For example, getting familiar with a few frontier models and knowing their nuances, their strengths, their weaknesses, knowing when to work in the terminal versus the IDE, when to delegate to sub aents versus keeping the context intact. We know the landscape is rapidly changing right now, and so you need to build the muscle of being able to quickly evaluate new tools and see whether they genuinely improve your workflow or not. That's why I began this video by tracing our recent history in this AI era so far. Because when we know where we've come from, we can more easily evaluate new tools and know what's genuinely new and useful. And when you can orchestrate your workflow, you're not just reacting to change, you're directing",
