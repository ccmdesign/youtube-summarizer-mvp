title: A guide to cardiorespiratory training at any fitness level to improve
  longevity (AMA 79 sneak peek)
description: >-
  In this “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) episode, Peter brings together his most
  up-to-date thinking on cardiorespiratory fitness into a single, practical
  guide designed to help listeners structure training for maximal impact on
  healthspan, lifespan, and long-term independence. He explains why
  cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the strongest modifiable predictors of
  longevity, clarifies what zone 2 training actually represents and how it
  differs from higher-intensity work, and addresses persistent confusion around
  exercise volume, intensity, and time constraints. The discussion covers how to
  measure and track progress in zone 2, VO₂ max targets and age-adjusted goals,
  planning for the marginal decade, and how to balance zone 2 with
  higher-intensity training across different weekly volumes. Peter also outlines
  how cardio training should be tailored for beginners, experienced trainees,
  and older adults, with special considerations for women and guidance on
  avoiding the most common cardio-training mistakes.

  00:10 - Rational for discussing cardiorespiratory fitness, zone 2, & VO₂ max
  despite having covered the topic extensively

  05:54 - Why cardiorespiratory fitness & VO₂ max are powerful & modifiable
  predictors of all-cause mortality compared with other health metrics

  11:40 - How age-related declines in VO₂ max constrain healthspan & everyday
  physical function

  13:25 - The cardiorespiratory fitness triangle: how different training
  intensities contribute to building the aerobic base, the aerobic peak, &
  overall aerobic capacity

  18:50 - The cellular mechanics of cardiorespiratory fitness: mitochondria,
  lactate, muscle fiber recruitment, & intensity thresholds

  28:34 - The debate over whether zone 2 training has unique benefits or whether
  higher-intensity exercise alone is sufficient

  34:20 - Balancing intensity & sustainability as training volume increases, &
  the important role of zone 2 training


  In the full episode, we also discuss:

  How to identify, measure, & track improvements for your zone 2 training & VO2
  Max

  How to set meaningful VO₂ max targets based on age, sex, & desired physical
  capabilities later in life

  How to structure & execute a zone 2 workout and VO2 max workout

  How to balance zone 2 & VO₂ max training

  How to structure training for someone limited to 150 minutes per week of total
  exercise

  Why spreading aerobic training across the week beats compressing volume into
  one session

  How beginners & metabolically unhealthy individuals should start
  cardiorespiratory training

  How “training age” determines the intensity & workload needed to continue
  improving cardiorespiratory fitness

  Why zone 2 training still matters for women (including postmenopausal women)

  How cardiorespiratory training should adapt with aging

  The most common mistakes people make; and

  More.
