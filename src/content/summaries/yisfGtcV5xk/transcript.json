  "fullText": "Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive podcast. I'm your host, Peter Aia. [music] Peter, welcome to another AMA. How you doing? >> I'm doing very well. Thank you for having me back. >> Always welcome to have you. I see every time we do these, you bring something more and more to each recording. [laughter] What what have what have I brought this time? I don't I'm not even aware. >> Nothing you can think of. Nothing jumps out. No new additions to the body? >> No. But given that we've now introduced carveouts at the end of these, I've it's made me that much more aware of um how much I am the perfect target of YouTube and Instagram ads because I could I could create an entire podcast called The Carveout where I just talk about, you know, the things that I buy when they're uh served up to me as ads that I end up liking. Have you bought one thing today? >> Uh, not today, but I did get something really awesome two days ago. It arrived two days ago. >> Anything you'd like to share with the group? >> Heck no. I'm saving it for a carveout uh maybe next month. I want I want to I put these things to the test. Let me tell you, I am a I am I'm a serious tester of product. So, the thing that I got so far, I've already tested it once. It was insanely good. So, I just need to I need a few more reps with it. And if if I'm still digging it in a month, it might it might make it to the carveout list. >> That's great. Uh it's exciting because I don't think people realize what you're talking about could be a legitimate thing that is actually beneficial to health and longevity. And it could be the dumbest $20 gadget that has ever existed. And we have no way of knowing which one it is when it comes to that spectrum. [laughter] Well, I'll give you a hint. It was served up on a YouTube ad, so it's definitely not the former, but I will say it's also not the latter. [laughter] >> Leaving people hanging. >> There there's a lot of daylight between those two. So, >> yes, you you just tend to live on the spectrums, though, right? Like you kind of go one or the other. >> That's fair. You know, it's like the only thing you do in moderation is moderation, which turns out is the same with engaging in YouTube and Instagram ads. You like to go all in. [sighs] So, with that said, what we're covering today, one topic, cardiorespiratory fitness, in simpler terms for people, zone 2 V2 max. So this is a topic we have talked about over the years on different podcasts, different guests, different articles, but it's also a topic that we get asked about by far the most partly because of the interest in it and also I think because of how open you are on how it is the biggest and strongest modifiable predictor of both health span and lifespan. Meaning it's the biggest impact that someone can do something about it. So that's why we decided to kind of dedicate this AMA, gather all the questions, and try to make it a one-stop shop for everything relating to how to measure, track, improve zone 2 V2 max through training. We'll cover how this relates to people who have a lot of time to work out, people who have a little time to work out. We'll look at how it relates to people who are just starting training, people who have been training for a long time, older adults, if anything changes for women in particular, and more. We'll also look at if your opinion has evolved around some recent debates and discussions around zone 2 lactate, how to balance volume and intensity with the goal of not having your best exercise month ever and then stopping, but more so long term. So, with all that said, anything else you want to add before we get started? >> Yes. Um, this was an idea that when the the team pitched it to me, um, my initial response was, I don't think this is worth it. We've already generated plenty of content on this. It's probably one of the things I talk about more. It's it certainly would be within the top five things that I talk about. Um, and the team I think was able to get me uh convinced and I and I believe rightly so by saying, \"Yeah, Peter, that's kind of the point is if someone were to try to go out there and aggregate everything you've said on this topic, it would be a full-time job and it would and I think someone even shared with me how many hours and hours of content it would be and it was, you know, tripledigit hours.\" Um, and they said that's great for the person with an encyclopedic memory who is a lifelong, you know, devote who doesn't have a job. Um, but most people aren't going to fit into that category and it would be really helpful to have a practical guide, not just a theoretical guide to this. Um, and so that that kind of won me over. Um, and so I guess I would just say kind of kudos to the team for convincing me that this was this was the way to do it. and and I'm I'm really kind of happy with the with the um the way they've kind of crafted a story around this. So, let's dive in. >> Before we do, quick question. Do you think if the team started to put their arguments in forms of videos that we ran as Instagram or YouTube ads, you'd be more willing to listen? >> I mean, if you could be good enough, but you you have to catch me within the first 10 seconds of the ad or I'm skipping it, right? So, you've like I don't know that that's a skill set that exists on our team. We don't we don't practice that skill of catch you in the first 10 seconds. >> No, we practice more of we will get you at the end of 2 hours after explaining in rigor. All right. So with that said, I think what would be helpful to start is looking at real quick why is cardiorespiratory fitness a central pillar and not only your approach to lifespan, how long you live, but health span. >> Yeah. So again, if you if you've been listening to me talk about this for for years, you can literally go to your podcast player and hit forward for a couple of minutes. You don't need to hear this. Um, but but I do want to spend at least a minute on this idea that that cardiorespiratory fitness is is one of the most important and modifiable. It's very important that we're talking about modifiable predictors of both how long you're going to live and how well you're going to live. Um and so if you look at all the predictors of all cause mortality, which remember that's the holy grail metric of longevity, cardiorespiratory fitness outperforms every other variable we can measure. This includes blood pressure, this includes cholesterol, this includes BMI, smoking, it even includes age, which just blows my mind. Um, so cardiorespiratory fitness, CRF, represents how efficiently your heart and lungs and blood vessels and muscles can work together to deliver and utilize oxygen. Um, so the more efficient that system is, the more physiologic reserve your body has. And it's this reserve that allows you to tolerate stress. This stress can come in the form of an infection, a surgery, uh, or just, you know, frankly, the day-to-day demands of living. Now, this has been most typically and most repeatedly measured using a test called V2 max. You've heard me talk about this, of course, um, and it's become a very popular thing that people talk about. It's the maximum rate at which the body can utilize oxygen. tested of course during maximal efforts which require exercise. Um so this number is expressed in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute. Um but it can be estimated using something called mets or metabolic equivalents where one met is equal to 3.5 millilit per kilogram per minute of oxygen uptake or utilization. Um, so I would say that the reason that V2 max has become such a popular way to do this is because it is a standardized test. That doesn't mean it's always done correctly. And we've got plenty of examples of how this can be done incorrectly, which is why for our patients, we actually do the test. We got sort of tired of relying on other labs to do it. Um, but for the most part, a well-trained technician can do this consistently. Um, and that makes it easy to study. And that's why in the literature you're going to see so much discussion where it comes down to METS or V2 max. The two can be used interchangeably. Um, and you won't, for example, see that when it comes to zone 2. So, we're going to talk a lot about that today, but I just want to point out zone 2 is a much more difficult area to navigate because it's not a maximal effort. It's an in between effort. Um, V2 max is a maximal effort. So when you tell somebody to basically floor it until they're going to keel over um that's that's actually much easier to achieve. Now to put some context around the importance of V2 max and mortality again because it's been studied um if you're in the bottom quartile or um quintile so bottom 20 to 25% of the population with respect to your V2 max you've got a four to fivefold higher risk of mortality all cause mortality in any given year than those in the top 3% 2 to 3%. Um so that's that's a that's a pretty big jump but keep in mind even tiny little jumps um you know say moving from uh the uh second quartile to the third quartile will still have uh easily a 50 to 75% um uh improvement in in all-c cause mortality. Um so so why is this such a powerful relationship? Um, and I think it comes down to not just what the number represents, which is everything I've talked about visav um, oxygen delivery and utilization, but I think it's it's and and I've I've said this before, but but I think it bears repeating. It's that measures like V2 max, just like strength, they're actually integrators of work done. So, um, if a person has a V2 max that is low and their aspiration is to have a very high V2 max, they can, but it will take potentially years and countless hours of work done. And that work will be done at the level of their cardiovascular system, their pulmonary system, their hematologic system, muscular system, metabolic system. All of those things will have to work and work and work for hundreds of hours to get a desired outcome. And if you think about that, that's much more frankly impressive from a physiologic perspective than taking a pill that lowers your cholesterol. And it's not to say that taking a pill that lowers your cholesterol doesn't improve outcomes, but it's not going to come close to improving outcomes as much as this does on average. There are edge cases. There are some individuals with familial hyper cholesterolimeia where you know that pill that lowers their cholesterol will have an outsized benefit but by and large this is why u things that improve cardiorespiratory fitness or strength uh tend to have such an impact on mortality >> and then beyond mortality can you also talk about the health span benefits so what you refer to as not only how long it can help you live but how well it can help you live >> yeah I think the argu argument here is just as strong. Of course, we just don't have the same uh the data are not quite as objective uh because health span is not as objective. So what what I might aspire to to be able to do that would define good health span for me might not be the same as you Nick and is not going to be the same as every person that is listening to us right now. But what we do know and and I think we'll show at least one figure to that effect today is that V2 max declines quite predictably with age at about 10% per decade. Um but um you know the oxygen cost of doing things doesn't change. So whether it be climbing stairs or uh lifting something up or chasing your kids around or playing a sport, those things don't change. So if you have a declining capacity to deliver and utilize oxygen in the in the presence of constant demand at some point those curves cross and what that effectively means is you start losing the ability uh to do these things. And again, we'll we'll talk about this in much more detail when we when we get there, but um as I as I as I think a figure can represent better than what I'm saying necessarily, um our objective is to be able to maintain optionality around being physical for as long as possible. And that is tantamount to having as high a V2 max as possible in addition to being as strong as possible. And when talking about cardiorespiratory fitness in the past to kind of help people understand it in a similar way, you've often talked about the base and peak model. Can you just walk through a little bit more about that framework and how different exercise and intensities can contribute to each component of that? >> Yeah. So I I talk about this cardiorespiratory fitness triangle and I can't I can't take credit for this at all. It was one of my cycling coaches that came up with this. Um so so the idea was that you you have a picture a triangle with a with a base and a peak. Um and the base is is what we think of as your capacity to do sustained submaximal effort over a long period of time. Um so think of something you could do for hours and then the peak is is represents your maximum aerobic output. So what you could sustain for you know 5 to 10 minutes. Um obviously there are you know so many gradations here right your functional threshold power which is what you could obtain for an hour is obviously much uh nar is you know is a smaller number than the than the than the peak uh and a shorter number than the base. So anyway, the goal here if if if you're trying to maximize your total aerobic capacity um is is to maximize the area of this, you know, cardiorespiratory triangle. And of course to do that, you want to have the widest base and the highest peak possible. Um and these require different forms of training. So if you just trained at one intensity level the whole time, you would increase both of these things. I want to be clear on that point because it creates so much confusion. If you only parked yourself at one level of training, you would through enough volume increase both of these. But that's not the way to maximize the problem. And it's certainly not the most timeefficient way to do it. Nor is it necessarily um the best way to do it. In fact, it's almost assuredly not given the fact that no high level athlete trains that way. So the the base is ideally built through adaptations that help you utilize oxygen more efficiently to convert fuel but mostly fat uh into ATP. So what this is really geared towards is improving mitochondrial density and efficiency and optimizing fat oxidation and lactate utilization. Conversely, the peak which again is that V2 max represents the ceiling for oxygen delivery um primarily but utilization um and it's driven by how how well this system can deliver oxygen to the mitochondria. That's primarily the bottleneck. It's how much oxygen can you deliver to mitochondria, right? Versus the base which is how much can you uh utilize substrate efficiently. So when it comes to delivering oxygen [clears throat] to the mitochondria, there are really four big drivers, right? So there there's the diffusion of oxygen from the lungs into the blood. There's cardiac output, so that's heart rate and stroke volume. Uh then there's the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, namely hemoglobin. Um and then there's the muscle's ability to extract this. But as I said a moment ago, it's the cardiac output that is the main driver here and it is the one we are most sensitive to in reduction. So again, uh what what drives cardiac output primarily is stroke volume, how much blood comes out of the heart with each pump and heart rate. And of course, when you're at a V2 max effort, you're getting to maximum heart rate. Um, so somewhere between 70 and 85% of the variability in V2 max is accounted for just by this one variable. Um, in the show notes, we'll include a whole bunch more detail on this if anybody kind of wants to nerd out on this stuff. I love this stuff. Um, but I don't want to spend any more time on it right right here. Um, so as I kind of alluded to, it's it's very tempting to and I want to take uh I want to apologize if I've ever created um the impression or or over oversimplified this and it's possible that I have um that you know zone 2 is what you do exclusively to build your base and high-intensity workouts is the only thing you do to build your peak. Um, as I said, these systems work together. And if all you did was zone two, you would absolutely get a wider base. You would also raise your peak. Um, similarly, if you did, you know, higher intensity training, you would increase your peak, but you would also widen your base a little bit. Um the key as we'll get into in the nuance is what is the optimized way to utilize time around different volume and intensity requirements. So um how much total work can you do? How much cardiorespiratory uh fitness training can you do? Um that's probably the single biggest determinant. But that involves a minmax problem which is a big part of what we're going to talk about today. So that's that's how I think about the triangle. >> And when talking about zone 2, you've often talked about fat oxidation, mitochondria, lactate. Often times I think these terms can be a little confusing for people and so I think it's always helpful to kind of like relook at them and explain it. So, do you mind just spending a few minutes walking through like the cellular mechanisms that are involved in cardiorespiratory fitness just so everyone is kind of familiar with the terms you may or may not use throughout here? >> Yeah. So, it's really funny because I've noticed some amazing memes on Instagram where you basically have people that are making fun of anybody that uses the word mitochondria. So somehow uh and I because I don't really pay attention to the uh the the wellness influencer uh health space. Apparently the word mitochondria is now just one of those buzzwords that you should throw around as much as possible. And so you know if you're if you're playing sort of wellness influencer bingo, you're going to get a lot of points for mitochondria. Um I can't remember some of the other awesome words that are just basically pathonommonic for buffoonery. Uh, can you you you I'm sure you've have you seen any of these memes? They're amazing. It's like mitochondria, inflammation, uh, gut biome, like they've got all the buzzwords, right? So, um, >> protein >> protein, I'm sure. Right. So, so you've set me up now to to to trigger a bingo card. Um, but I guess you're right there. You can't have this discussion without doing this. So, so hopefully I'm going to get an exemption for my use of the word mitochondria here. So um at the foundation of your cardiorespiratory system um are these organels called mitochondria. And of course all of you who took a high school class in biology will remember that they're referred to as sort of the little power units of the cell. And the majority of our ATP is is produced by them. And again ATP is the currency for energy. Um, and I just because I can't resist giving one more lay of level of detail. The way the way ATP work is they donate ATP has three phosphates. They donate one of those phosphates and it's that liberation of energy that comes from that chemical bond uh that creates energy. So you know the mitochondria can generate ATP from either fatty acids or pyuvate. pyuvate is is is the breakdown is a is a intermediary breakdown product of of glucose via a process called glycolysis. And both of these processes are constantly occurring. Um it's just the question is what's the balance in which they're occurring? And of course, are these both equal? No, they're not. Right? Each process has a tradeoff. So the trade-off would simply be stated this way. If you are optimizing for efficiency and you don't care as much about the speed with which you can deliver ATP, you want to take that more aerobic pathway, meaning utilizing oxygen and shuttling the breakdown product of fatty acid or glucose um either in the form of pyuvate or acetal coa into the mitochondria uh to use an oxidative pathway to generate lots of ATP per units of carbon that go The problem with that is as the demand for ATP accelerates, you have to make a trade-off. You have to make a sacrifice. The body says, \"I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. I have to go down this quicker path using glycolysis where I turn glucose into pyuvate, ultimately into lactate. I don't get nearly as many ATP for it, but I can do this. I can deliver much more ATP to the muscle. Now, I can't do this indefinitely. There's a whole problem associated to that which we'll talk about, but that's effectively at the high level the trade-off. So, another way to think about this is through the lens of the fibers that are involved. And again, these are terms we've used on the podcast before, but this the goal of this podcast is to kind of tie this all together. So, at lower intensities, you have these type one or slow twitch muscle fibers. And again, I think the term slow twitch, it's um uh it it it it does to some extent reflect the speed with which they twitch. But I think a more important way to think about them is they're slow to fatigue. Um, and they're more endurance-based fibers. So again, at lower intensities, they're the ones that are doing all the work. Very rich in mitochondria, deep red. Uh, they excel at oxidizing fat. Um, and they're very, very efficient. As the intensity increases, we have to start recruiting more of the type 2 fibers. These are fast twitch fibers which again are more contractile in their force but they're also fast to fatigue. They have less mitochondria and they're going to recruit uh and rely more heavily on glycolysis. Um that's happening outside the mitochondria. So, um, initially lactate, which again kind of gets a bit of a bad rap, but again, we've done an entire podcast on this and we'll we'll link to the podcasts on this topic. But the most important of these is definitely the one with George Brooks. Um, initially the lactate gets recycled locally. Um, so it's shuttled um to neighboring type one fibers. So type it gets generated in the type two fiber, gets shuttled to a type one fiber. it gets converted back into pyuvate and then the pyuvate goes into the mitochondria to produce more ATP. Um that's called the lactate shuttle. Um but again these things are constrained by demand and therefore as output increases and demand increases lactate production in the type 2 fibers begins to exceed the capacity uh for for what can be done locally right in the in the mitochondria adjacent and at that point lactate spills into the bloodstream. So if you were measuring lactate in the bloodstream with a continuous lactate monitor, which by the way, these things are uh easily in prototype and there's some that are right on the market. So this would be something you can appreciate in the future. You might start out an exercise session where your lactate is, you know, resting at 0.5 mill. Um everything I just described up until this point would not increase that even though locally lactate levels are rising. Um but once it starts spilling into the bloodstream now you actually have to rely on other tissues in the body. The heart other other muscles that are not being you know utilized at this point in time they have to start clearing it using lactate as fuel as we've even learned from George Brooks. The brain will do this as well. The liver also can convert that lactate back into glucose via glucanogenesis. Um, and this basically allows the body to maintain certain levels of lactate um, at a new baseline that is above the original baseline. Um, this is usually referred to as the first lactate threshold. And again, for a metabolically healthy individual, um, and someone who's metabolically flexible, meaning they can go back and forth between utilizing glucose and fatty acids, this falls at about 2 mill of lactate. Um, that is what we refer to as zone 2. Now again, if some of those conditions aren't met, if you're not a metabolically flexible person, using that uh first threshold of lactate um at 2 mill is not going to happen. There are people who walk around at rest with a lactate level above two. Okay. But the point here is you can maintain you're now at a new steady state where if you remember the first steady state is where the local tissues are able to uh offset lactate production at the rate that um uh it's being produced right consumption and production are equal locally. Then you have this sort of second level which we refer to as the first lactate threshold because it's the first one we're measuring in the plasma. And that's where now the systemic tissues are able to balance it. But now we get to a third level um of lactate which is really called the second lactate threshold and that's at higher and higher levels. And at this point once the body gets above that level um and this level varies quite a bit by individual um I'm not going to maybe maybe if we have time I'll go into how you can measure that. I I talked about this at length in the first podcast with um um with with um uh Olaf Alexander Buu. Um but um but we can come back to that. But but anyway, these higher levels of output, glycolytic lactate production in the working muscles completely s um surpasses the body's ability to clear it. At this point, blood lactate starts to rise much more sharply. Um it accompanies um it's accompanied by hydrogen ion, right? Because the the lactate um is is negatively charged. The hydrogen is positively charged. So they're balanced kind of one to one. Um you have this acidity that occurs. Um and the it turns out that the it's the hydrogen ion and not the lactate that is effectively poisoning the muscle. It it actually prevents the actin and meosin filaments in the muscle from being able to relax. Um again for most people that second lactate threshold or really third one depending on how you're counting them um occurs somewhere between four and five mill of lactate. Again that can be that's that's that's a much more variable number. Okay. [snorts] So I'm going to I'm going to stop there. There's a lot we could talk about there, but but I hopefully that kind of sets the sets the groundwork. >> Very much so. [snorts] I think maybe worth clicking on to zone 2 before we get further in a little bit of a different way because it seems like there's been a lot of discussion lately on whether it has unique benefits, whether it's just better to focus on higher intensity work only. So, how do you think about this question? >> I think it comes down to context. I think there's a lot of confusion around this. So, so I hopefully I'll do my best to dispel that. Um there's there's ideas out there challenging the idea that zone 2 um is is special or magical or there's anything that's that's good about it. Um and there are certainly people who would assert that highintensity work produces the same or even greater adaptations. Um and I think honestly in the framework that some people are proposing that it is true. Okay. So, so let's now sort of think through this. Um, if you are uh so, so, so for for the proponents of highintensity exercise, people who say don't waste your time doing zone 2, um, the shorter the amount of exercise time that a person has, the more true that is. Because remember something I said a few minutes ago which is if you really want to maximize the area of your triangle nothing beats volume. Now can't be volume like walking won't do it. So you have to have some you have to get to zone 2 this first place where you have some adaptation. Um but the more time you spend there the better. And so if we're going to talk about a professional athlete or even a recreational athlete, if you're going to talk about uh the way I trained 10 or you know 10 to 15 years ago, the way I trained where by some miracle I still was managing to spend 14 to 16 hours a week on a bike. Um then we can get into the nuance of how that time should be divided. So now let's turn this over to kind of someone who's going to adhere to the general guidelines. So, the general guidelines says you should exercise uh ideally 150 minutes per week. So, that's two and a half hours per week. Um, and I'm sure the guidelines would be happy if you did more, but that's what we're trying to get people to, right? Most people are not exercising 2 and 1/2 hours per week. And truthfully, if if that's all you can adhere to, then zone 2 is not going to be an efficient use of your time because it doesn't provide a sufficient enough training stimulates to drive the adaptations to make the triangle bigger. And remember that 150 minutes is total exercise. Well, part of that's going to have to be some resistance training. So, even if you said, \"I'm going to carve out an hour uh for two 30 minute resistance training workouts in a week,\" then you've got an hour and a half for cardio. You know, truthfully, I would say then all of that time should be done at high intensity. You should probably have two 45minute highintensity workouts. Um, but when I talk about training, I'm not, and maybe I should be, but I'm generally not talking to that population. When I'm talking to my patients in that population, it's a different story. And we do, we're very clear that, you know, if you've only got two and a half hours this week to exercise, we're going to craft your program around that. Um, but but I'm sort of talking to a person who is really thinking about how to optimize and achieve their best results over, you know, both lifespan and health span over decades. And if that's the case, then you're going to need more volume than 150 minutes a week. And then that means you're going to have to utilize different levels of intensity. So because zone two is this point at which lactate rises to the level where it's now in the bloodstream. Um so local tissues can't clear it. Uh but your body is able to clear it. You're stressing the system. This is the first place where you're now really stressing the system enough to recruit more glycolytic fibers. But what's nice about this is the intensity is low enough that you can keep going for a long enough period of time. And this is why endurance athletes who are training for, you know, 15 to 20 hours a week are indeed spending basically 80% of their time in this zone because the intensity is low enough that they can do it for so long and yet they are still getting a training adaptation. So, if you are training in zone 2, while you're not getting as much adaptation as you're getting at zone 5, uh you're still applying a strong enough training stimulus to activate muscle uh sorry, both fuel systems, right? So, you're you know, you're not maximal, but you're near maximal for fat oxidation. You have some glycolysis. You have lactate shuttle but you don't have the wear and tear of the acidity and the fatigue that comes when lactate production completely overwhelms clearance uh systemically. So again you can pack in volume of training um in a way that you can't with very high intensity. Um there are other benefits to zone 2 by the way if you're an athlete which is it comes with the improved um with the benefits of improved movement efficiency. Um I discussed this um you know on a on a on a podcast as well. So um I I guess I hope that clarifies kind of the context around uh one versus the other. And in looking in terms of like spending more time than the bare minimum when it comes to exercise, how does then exercise intensity play a role into the relationship of volume and sustainability? >> So once you're not constrained by that 150 minutes per week and and honestly that's my hope. My hope is that everybody listening to us right now even though once in a while they might be constrained by that but that they can find more time to exercise. um the limiting factors start to become fatigue and recoverability uh and even to some extent adherence and I think that that's especially as you get older fatigue and recoverability become real limiting factors. So again higher intensity workout uh workout in zone 5 uh very important um and should always be a part of your training. you can't do that much of it once you get into your 40s and 50s. Uh again, when you're in your 20s and and even into your 30s, you can still hammer these workouts. Um but you know, I can't do those workouts three or four times a week anymore. Um and and I don't think most people listening right now can either. So, um, if you're going to be able to devote more time to your training, you're going to have to be able to, um, do so at a lower physiologic cost. And, and again, volume drives adaptation. That's the thing to remember. It's volume above all else that's driving adaptation, provided that volume is at least at zone two where you start to um, undergo all those changes we discussed. So, um, basically there's there's a, you know, uh, you know, there's a cost of doing highintensity work. And by the way, part of that is adherence-based. Um, it's it's more painful, it's more fatiguing, and it's harder to sustain. Um, so, uh, you know, one of the things I tell patients who are bored when they're doing zone 2 is, look, use it as an opportunity to get really caught up on your favorite podcast or your favorite audio book or something like that. um something that frankly is a little bit harder to do during a high-intensity workout where you're probably not as a not as able to to concentrate rather. So taking it back to you know basically the critics of zone 2 um they're correct in a narrow sense in that per unit time high inensity training delivers more physiologic adaptation. Um but they're kind of wrong in the way that that it matters. It's not that zone 2 is magical. It's that it's practical and it becomes more and more uh valuable as your volume increases. So in short um I think zone 2 is the cornerstone that lets you do enough work, enough volume safely and consistently so that you get the adaptations you need to be an athlete for life. Moving on now to look at how someone can measure zone 2 and V2 max understand what they are. Um when is it useful? How do you go about measuring it?
