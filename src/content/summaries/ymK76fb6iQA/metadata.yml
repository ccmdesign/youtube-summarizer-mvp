title: Why Meta's VL-JEPA Destroys All LLMs
description: |-
  VL-JEPA from Meta is a vision-language model that works differently from other LLMs developed under Yann LeCun's guidance. This model represents a breakthrough in how AI can understand and predict what it sees. 

  Unlike common AI models that make text one word at a time, VL-JEPA uses a special method. It guesses hidden meanings directly from pictures and videos. It delivers strong results with half the parts to train and up to 2.85 times faster speed. Learn how this new idea helps with understanding videos, answering questions about images, and quick real-world uses. It brings us closer to AI that thinks more like people.
