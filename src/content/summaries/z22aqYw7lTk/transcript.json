  "fullText": "[music] Well, hey there folks. What's going on? Welcome to another edition of Smashing Meets. It feels like it's been a little while since the last one of these. At least the last one of these that I've been a part of. Um, but here we are again. It's the end of the year. It's December if you can imagine that already. And uh we're going to be talking about easy accessibility. And I'll have to admit when I first saw that, you know, that little label easy next to accessibility, my heart kind of like went ah you know because like when is accessibility easy, right? Uh if accessibility was super easy then then like we wouldn't need the like web aim one million sites uh report each year, right? Uh you know saying that like oh like know 70% of all websites are you know have contrast issues and things like that. Um, so I'm very excited to talk about this because we have we have three great uh experts here to talk us to talk to us about practical ways that we can implement uh accessible practices into our work. Uh, hi, my name is Jeff. Um, I am this guy with really skinny legs in an illustration. Um, but yeah, I I'm an editor um here at Smashing Magazine and uh yeah, you know, they just happen to put me in front of a camera like this every once in a while so that I get to annoy you. uh a little bit. So anyway, I'm just happy to be here. Um and I also want to remind everyone that we have a code of conduct. Basically, it's get this, it's really simple. Everybody's welcome. We be friendly and we be cool to to each other. That's really it. You know, basically just good human beings to one another. And that's because we all have stories to tell at the end of the day. And what you're going and what you're about to see are three talks that include stories. And with stories, we want you to pay attention to them. We want you to watch them. We want you, you know, just to really be to be engaged with it. But more than that, like I want you to to recognize that, you know, all stories kind of have a narrative and an arc to them, right? So there's going to be struggles, there's going to be failures uh when that happen, you know, that we encounter um in the process. And that's part of the storytelling process. And so you're going to, you know, uh, you know, to see how some, uh, some difficult things are are approached and we're going to learn something at the end of the day based on on personal experiences. So that's why, you know, we have this this code of of conduct and why we want you to really, you know, feel like you're you're engaging in this and really taking the the stories in. Um I do want to take um a moment and thank our sponsor um Alley Plan here. Um it's like this is a really cool um online tool. You can go in, you can you can actually uh scan or like analyze a page and and and surface uh accessible or accessibility issues on your page and you can even like select like how deep you want it to go in and extract information into. Uh we'll have some more information on this as well, but just thank you to Alip Plan for their support of this event. Uh if you if you want to follow along with captions, you can go to smash.by/captions where we'll be keeping a record of those. Um, and hey, you know, if you're on um, you know, if you don't know it already, um, you know, you're probably part of the Smashing Meets community, and we have a, um, a Slack channel over there for you to to, um, to come into and to converse and discuss and be a part of that community. Um, and hey, are the hashtags still a thing? If they are, um, go ahead and, you know, on socials, hashtag us with smashing comp um, as you're discussing this stuff. And speaking of like social connections and just like icebreaking um in general, why don't you go and tell us where you where you're from? Uh we have this like chat going on over at Veto and um and you can, you know, just just say, \"Hey, um I'm I'm dialing or I'm signing in from here or there. I am in Northern Colorado and we just got our first snow last week. I'm very excited about that. My mom was actually in town for it, so you know, it kind of felt like like a nice early Christmas celebration.\" Um, and uh, I'm wondering how many of you are in snow right now and how many of you don't have to deal with snow at this point in time. U, so that's that's really about it for right now. Um, what we are going to to have here for you are three incredible speakers. Um, we're going to pull up a slide here that uh, that shows them right here. Uh, we have Emily Anderson, Marcel Bertram, and Michelle Williams. But guess what? It's not going to be in that order. Uh, in fact, we are going to uh to start with with Michelle. And uh you know, one second here. I I actually wanted to pull something up for myself that I should have had up here. Um, one second. You know, it's always one of those things where it's like you feel like you're you're super prepared, then then you realize, oh yeah, I have that I have that one thing I need to to focus on. Um anyway, like um I do want to like let you know that that Michelle Williams uh she's pretty incredible. She's the owner of an accessibility consultancy and she's the author of the book Accessible UX Research, which is actually available today in ebook form. If you go over to our book section over at smashingmagazine.com, you can purchase that book today. Um, just know that the print um edition is coming out in 2026 and but if you do get it today, you will have immediate access to the to the ebook version of it. Um, yeah. So, you know, check that out because, you know, it's all about inclusive practices and it will give you good practical um information for how to, you know, make your own work more accessible and get your teams more involved in that as well. Um, anyway, Michelle, her talk is called How to Start Talking to Disabled Users. Now, you're going to learn simple ways to recruit, prepare, and run sessions that center accessibility without needing perfect tooling or big budgets, stuff like that. Um, and because at the end of the day, the best way to build accessible experiences isn't waiting until everything is flawless. It's starting the conversation. So, with that, I want to welcome Michelle up to the stage. >> Thank you so much, Jeff, and thank you for the introduction. Oh, so great to have you here. Welcome to Smashing the Meets. >> Thanks. All right. Well, let's go ahead and dive in. Um, and hopefully everybody's ready to go. So, as mentioned, I'm Michelle Williams. I am both a digital accessibility specialist as well as a UX researcher. So, I love spending time talking about this intersection. Uh, so again, the talk is about stop waiting for perfect. and we're going to dive into hopefully some ways that folks can even start today, tomorrow, next week on getting more inclusive in their research practices. Um, I did get a note that they're working on the captions as well. So hopefully folks can follow along on the slides until then. Uh, just one note about my disability language. I do use identity first, which as in disabled people, um, I align with those that feel disability is not a bad word, but rather a descriptor. So I just like to make that clear at the top because I know some folks um use for instance people first. So I just want to make a note that that's going to be my language going forward. So with that I want to begin with the state of where we are now in terms of the idea of including disabled folks in our UX research practices particularly in industry and that is the fallacy of being unequipped. So a typical UX research process in industry sort of has this cycle that starts maybe with a request like from the uh program manager or from the designers uh just based on maybe the features that are coming out. there's some sort of request to answer some particular questions about this product or about this direction. Um that's given to the team that then in turn moves into recruiting for the study uh moderation of the study or facilitating it and then reporting out the findings and then we sort of go through that cycle again. And so uh what often happens is people feel that once they get into this cycle they can't break it to include disabled participants. So the requests aren't made from the teams to do this. Uh the recruitment that they use or the maybe the services or panels they use don't include disabled uh markers. So they don't know who disabled participants might be. Uh the moderation tools maybe don't account for accessibility and then the reporting doesn't necessarily have a place for accessibility insights or more inclusive disability focused insights. So folks feel that they've got to stay in this cycle and it can never be undone. But the reality is that inclusion is a process choice. So we don't need to consider this um something that cannot be altered. Instead we need to start recognizing that uh when it comes to requests accessibility and inclusion don't need an invitation. These things are automatic or should be. When it comes to recruitment, there are several avenues available to find the right people for the right studies that we're doing. When it comes to moderation, the tools are helpers, not requirements. So, if your tool is not accessible for what you need, you can use other tools for instance. And then when it comes to reporting, accessibility insights are product insights. So, there really should not be um a uh division there. And really uh your report is usually incomplete if it does not consider those diverse perspectives. So really what I want to say is that we already adapt processes for participant inclusion just not for disabled participants. Uh so this is one of the first points I really wanted to call out and here's what I mean by that. If we think about how we go about uh putting together a research study or research activities, we already make adaptations. So we make sure that the uh tools that we use to collect the data are as frictionless as possible. They work with the computer systems that the participants have. Uh they work within the um uh technical understanding that the participants may have. We kind of come up with systems and ways to make sure that we can gather the data that we want based on how the participants would understand being able to do that. We schedule based on time zone or how people spend their day. So we're mindful that someone may work during the day or have school for instance. So we schedule around that or we also might do unmodderated methods to maximize the collection. We may understand that uh people need to do things on their own time or we need a wider array of uh feedback that would take too much time if a [clears throat] um researcher did it you know one by one. So we make all of these adaptations and really good research adapts to the people in it. So then why do we feel we can't do that when it comes to disability considerations? The answer is that we can and we should. So that's what I wanted to step through a little bit more for the remainder of the time. Making this cycle inclusive, this this sort of request, recruitment, moderation, reporting cycle. How do we go about making that inclusive? And as Jeff said at the top, maybe not all of these are quote unquote easy, but they are doable. They are practical. and they are things that should not take a lot of time or um should not take away from uh any other efforts but really they should be adding into the efforts that you're doing. So the first is the requests and one of the constraints that I mentioned you know earlier uh is that there's no requests for inclusive research. Those requests just don't often arrive. Um and in in particular um the research requests often focus on future validation where accessibility is rarely explicitly requested as a consideration or a focus. And then in some cases inclusion is quietly or even loudly discouraged. So waiting for quote unquote permission keeps the cycle intact, keeps the cycle of not including uh disabled participants in that disability perspective in the research. So the reality though is that inclusion doesn't depend on the ask. Really what's happening is uh disabled people are already using usually whatever you're making using whatever product you're putting out and not including disabled participants in research doesn't change this. You're just ignoring or overseeing the insights. It doesn't mean that people just aren't using your product. Um also research questions usually apply across disability status. So oftentimes people think, well, we're not doing an accessibility study today. Well, you don't need to do an accessibility study today. Really, there there is a need for that at times, but really um your product, the way that you are going about it should be inclusive of every disability because again disability, disabled folks are using your product or trying to. So therefore, your research questions don't even necessarily alter because of that. It's more the considerations. And so really excluding disabled participants doesn't protect your timeline. It just limits what you learn. You basically are not learning the insights that are coming from being intentional about u the audience that you're putting into your study because that reflects the audience that is using your product. So with that what's the action step when it comes to u this idea of u this cycle that we have? It's to break the pattern. Um, so really we need to change our mindset really is what all of this is going to come down to in this first part. And again, that's straightforward, that's practical, that's easy. Um, because what we want to do is start to shift to treating disability as a participant characteristic, not a special study. You really, if you've done any number of studies in your career, for those of you who are researchers or who do research as part of your uh position, you've likely already had disabled participants in your research, you may just not have known it. Disability is very prevalent and I'm probably um speaking to people who already know this on this call, but uh there are statistics that there are billions basically of bill of disabled folks in the world. So if there are billions of disabled folks in the world and you've done studies for any number of years, you've likely had disabled folks in your research already. They just didn't disclose it or you didn't ask or it wasn't something that you focused on. So acting like we um don't need to do this, shouldn't do this, we don't do this when it comes to inclusive research is actually again a fallacy that we need to just understand is not the right way of thinking. then we need to adjust our methods which we're going to you know continue to kind of talk about throughout but not necessarily the research goal. Um including disability doesn't need to change your research questions. Again if disabled folks are using your product then that means that they have the same considerations as anyone that doesn't have a disability. Those things do not change. They're still trying to use your product the best way possible. So therefore, what you're doing is just considering more people and more diverse audiences in that testing. You're not necessarily only looking for certain um considerations. You're looking more broadly um and you're making sure that the audience again is more diverse. So then what we need to do is include at least one disabled person in your next study. Also remembering that disability is diverse. And so when I say disabled participants in research, particularly if we're talking about web and mobile, people tend to jump right to screen blind screen reader users. Even within screen reader users, not all of uh the users are blind, let alone is blind screen reader user the encompassing of the entire gamut of uh disability categories or disability considerations. Um so instead we need to um be more broad in even our understanding of disability and recognize that having a quote someone who identifies as disabled in a study can mean any number of sensory cognitive physical uh conditions that then again bring us that diversity that we're looking for in the con in the considerations of of the findings of our study. So, you can do this. You can include at least one disabled participant in your next research. And we're going to talk about some of the strategies for recruiting and all of that. But again, nonetheless, it's likely you might just need to ask your current participants, do they have a disability that they identify with? So, but overall again the first action sort of step is to break the pattern of thinking that we're in such a pattern that we cannot um loop in disability uh considerations into it. That's not true and that is possible to do. So then it becomes okay if we want to include a disabled person how do we recruit for disabled folks? We don't know where to do that. And so you'll hear teams say that their panels or the channels they use um don't capture disability um categories. Uh there's not a way to identify disabled folks or it's poorly represented. And then you'll also um get some maybe some feedback or even push back that it feels timeconuming or expensive. So therefore it's deferred until this unknown later stage. And then lastly, disability circles feel unknown. But that's because when disability is invisible in society in general, disabled folks feel, I guess I said, you know, far away. They feel distant. They feel um disconnected to to the folks that are running the research. But through sorry, the reality is that recruitment is broader than your typical panels, right? So let's say you have panels, you have a recruitment system. Um those aren't the only legitimate recruitment sources. So there are recruitment firms and there are internal efforts that can yield results. Additionally, disabled users already probably exist in at least your customer base as we talked about. You're simply sometimes just not gathering or collecting that that disability identification as part of their characteristics. So if that's the reality that there are other sources and that there are other ways to do this, then the action step here is to expand where and how one might recruit. So um the first easiest step is to update your current screeners. So as you're sending out screeners, include disability category identification questions. And on the next um future slides, I'm going to highlight a um link that's going to u talk about how to do that. Um also, we want to collect this via um secondary screeners. So, if you've already uh recruited participants, you can also just ask by the way, do you identify as having a disability even after they've been recruited? So between updating your current screeners to uh capture any disability identification and then asking this as part of your current studies, you may be surprised to find you already have recruited or are capable of recruiting disabled participants in your research. And then you can start to build a database via public recruiting. Now this depends on your organization um and how you want to go about doing that. But one way is to start with what we call snowball sampling with your employees and current participants. So snowball sampling is asking someone who's already been recruited for your research if they know someone else that would like to be a participant. Well, particularly once you find someone who has a disability, they likely know other people who have disabilities or they may just know someone in their circle who has disabilities. So you can start with the folks again that are internal to your company. um whether they know someone or have someone or they themselves, if that's not too much of a conflict, would like to be in your database. And then again, you can also make that just an optional question for the participants you've already gathered. Give uh based on your organization and how things are set up as well. You may be able to also just recruit via social media and maybe some pointed mailing lists that are available. Now, some are more open than others and some calls are going to be received better than others, but nonetheless, you can be very transparent that we are building a roster and we want to make sure it's inclusive of folks with disabilities and get their voices heard. So, please fill out this uh interest form and do that securely. do that in a way that's um of course going to meet all of your ethics requirements, but you can start to build a database of participants who identify as having disabilities, who identify as using certain or who um use certain assisted technologies and then you can go from there. So this doesn't have to be something that is um unattainable because maybe the current service you use doesn't do that. Although also I would say you can very easily push back on the systems you do use as well. I didn't include that here, but um there's also opportunity to ask your current panel um kind of companies or ways that you recruit to help you with this as well. If that's what you're paying them to do is to to find participants, then you need to ask them to help you find disabled participants and assisted technology users as well. So, I mentioned a um link I was going to have the folks help me put into the chat as well. uh on medium there's an entire guide called a practical guide to inclusive research that I highly recommend but within that there's a story or a article called reaching out to disability communities. That article in particular if you scroll down has a um set of very practical screener questions. So if you're not even sure what screener questions to ask, you know, how to ask about disability or assist of technology usage, I highly recommend this article uh on the Medium platform. if you have access to it and again this whole practical guide to inclusive research it has some great insights in it. So and thank you for putting that in the main chat for me. So let's say we uh get to the idea or we get through the idea of recruiting. Well then there's the moderation. So for instance the constraint often there is uh our tools and artifacts aren't accessible. So then folks are looking at their research platforms, their prototyping tools and they end up delaying research waiting for fully accessible tools. You know they exclude disabled participants until again that later. This is how we continue to have that theme of we'll do it later, we'll do it later and later never comes. Meanwhile, um, accessibility shows up late, if at all, in the product considerations, usually through those occasional late stage audits that the company might um, kind of commission from an accessibility firm, but that's not the same as user research. And let's be very clear, I'm I'm uh replacing the word accessibility and inclusion different ways, but when we're talking about research, it's not just about the baseline accessibility considerations that we're used to like WCAG for web, but these are the users perspective mixed in with um just the general usability. So accessibility and usability are going to be mixed in that way because yes something may be able to be accessed by my assisted technology but did I understand what was happening? Did I understand the path? Was I even in the right path? You know all of these other considerations that come up in say usability studies apply the same. Just access is part of that or if we're doing early stage research which disabled folks should be part of that as well. those things like uh your current practices and current pain points should be illuminated from a disability perspective as well so that the features we create and the directions we take on the products that we make can be inclusive just the same. So with that the reality is moderation and prototypes can be reimagined. So we first need to get out of a mindset that the tools sort of dictate everything. um tools facilitate research, they don't define it. So there are several accessible ways to connect and communicate with participants to conduct a study. And yes, it can be um difficult to step outside of again that cycle or the systems that you might typically use, but unless and until those systems that you typically use can be inclusive, I say you need to step outside of them regardless because we need to make sure that we are gathering the right kind of feedback. So if the tool you're using doesn't allow you to collect the right kind of feedback should it be the tool that you're using then um there are also valid ways to um create alternatives to inaccessible prototypes and I'm going to step through an article I wrote about this um in a moment but the things like well use a survey uh conduct code design test with an existing system or with um a rapid prototype or just use a simulation uh in the form of the wizard of Oz method. it. There are ways to still collect information about the thing you're building even if you don't have the thing that you're building available to you. So, as you know, sitting down and just having a conversation or a semi structured interview can still yield findings even if you don't yet have an assessable prototype to use. So, a lot of this is not only taking practical steps, but breaking out of a certain uh mindset that says we can't do this. we don't have um what we need to um get this done. So the action step here is that we need to prioritize accessessibility through flexible moderation. So firstly um we need to map your method to the simplest accessible tools. This is what I mean by breaking out of your mindset. So when it comes to say the facilitation or moderation offer communication and data collection choices that fit the participants that you are engaging with. So video maybe someone makes an asynchronous video for you. Um email uh documents you know word documents or Google doc uh surveys and so on. So, for instance, if you're doing a diary study, um you don't necessarily need to use an inaccessible diary study app and therefore it means that you know certain participants can't uh participate. You can instead go back to some of the other tools maybe like email or putting together a document or having them upload photos to a cloud drive. So you don't necessarily need to stay in a rut of inaccessible ecosystems because um we can make sure that we're using tools that are accessible to get the job done. Similarly for a prototype again I'm going to step through that in a moment. We can use alternative methods to make sure that the feedback is getting into the loop. We don't have to stay with the idea that oh well our prototype isn't accessible so we just can't get that feedback. Unfortunately, I've been in situations like that where projects move forward and people literally have said to me, \"Oh, I heard you can't conduct your research because the prototype's not accessible, but I'm going to keep going.\" That's not the right mindset and that's not how this is going to change. Um, that's not how the discrimination against disabled folks, if we're really being honest, is going to change. If if folks are not if folks continue to be okay with leaving folks out, then we're not going to be able to shift this. So instead, we need to use what is accessible to us for now and advocate for more accessible solutions going forward. With that, you can also use your research to learn about accessibility. This is all sort of um intertwined and uh sort of all goes together. So as a researcher, you're sitting with someone who needs accessibility, right? So building the flexibility to ask participants about that in your study. Ask them to explain their assisted technology, their workflows, their expectations, what they're doing, how best to do it. These are things that you can incorporate, particularly if you do a more moderated study with the opportunity for um for uh questions and and discussion. Build that into your uh pro build that into your protocol so that you can get that understanding and take that back to your team. You craft the study. So craft it in a way that's going to be as actionable for your team as possible. Again, going back to using those methods that we talked about. So with that, this the next article I wanted to drop in the chat is this one, conducting accessibility in an inaccessible ecosystem because particularly when we're talking about middle and late stage projects, uh we are going to be trying to use some sort of prototype or built system in order to get uh feedback. So if we think about the stages of UX research, the first stage is usually something more foundational like say we are trying to understand current pain points and current practices. Those typically don't need as much uh alteration in the methods to be accessible because we can again just use the systems that are available to us to get that information or observe what we need. But once we start building out products, a lot of times those prototyping systems don't give us what we need to uh be able to conduct our studies with those prototypes in an accessible way. So this article steps through five ways that I believe you might be able to get around that. The first is to use a survey. So, one of the things I mentioned in the article, for instance, is that um maybe you think about what your research question really is and then could there be an opportunity to extrapolate that into just an online survey. So, for instance, if you're doing information architecture or you want to know if your menu structure is understandable, you can present a scenario and then ask people which menu option would you select. This doesn't necessarily need a built system in order to do that and you can still get that feedback or as we talked about gathering just general feedback about how folks would go about a task or how folks would use their technology to do a certain thing can all be gathered in the form of say a document a shared document or a survey. Um the other method I mentioned is code design. So in the photo I this is me a few years back um working on a hardware device and we were prototyping with some lowfidelity tools like pipe cleaners and a clipboard. Um, so this works a lot with hardware, but it also works when we're talking about web and uh app design in that we can work with participants to co-create a design and then that starts the discussion around what are those considerations, what what is most important and we can start to understand the user's point of view again without having to necessarily sit down with a prototype and in some ways this is not therefore influenced by the prototype that has been uh developed. we can get a uh firstperson perspective from the participant that's not again influenced by what someone has already created. Uh using an existing or a similar system to test uh is an option because a lot of times what your team is working on has been inspired by another company or another similar system. Uh we there's always a competitor system uh or maybe even a legacy system that can be used to gather insights and gather that feedback. And here I have pictured a Mozilla site that's showing their uh inspector tool, the developer inspector tool because if you're really advanced, you can on the fly make changes say to a website while you're on the call as well using the inspect tool. So there are ways to again have these conversations or have these uh insights gathered with existing or similar tools before your system is updated. You can also build a rapid prototype, particularly if you're talking about a website. Um, there are some tools that can help you create accessessible prototypes of say an inaccessible Figma or some other u prototype or uh instantiation of that system that hasn't yet been built. So, this is an example of a client that had um a s a website redesign in Figma that wasn't going to be available to be used by uh some of my participants, particularly my screen reader participants, but I wanted screen reader input early before the system went out. So, I rebuilt the website in a very crude way in Google Sites. It's free. It was accessible. And it allowed us to almost have a code design session because I was able to give feedback about what should be a heading or what should be the alternative text for these images right on the spot. And even in real time, I made changes and redeployed the site during the study. So building a an equivalent system might be available. There's some drawbacks because I could not build the same thing for users who were low vision and some users who had neurodeiversity that impacted the visual displays they wanted like dark mode. But we then were able to use the uh prototype that wasn't fully accessible to again have a conversation about what considerations needed to be made and we pulled up similar sites as well during those conversations. So again going back to being flexible, being imaginative. Now the last one is definitely not easy uh but using Wizard of Oz is uh possible in that you can simulate the system uh through this method whatever that system looks like. In this case I have an image of Ally Financial talking about simulating screen reader usage and having users step through what they would do with their screen reader and then they were able to play back the prompt. very detailed um a lot of work on the front end but it allows screen reader users to be part of the early prototyping process. So you have to weigh this against you know all of your other considerations but keep in mind that all of this is also very important for advocacy for education for normalizing the idea of feedback early and often from a diverse set of participants. So anything that you can do to cobble together maybe your system um that also is an opportunity. Um, so I think they mentioned my book earlier. One of the things I talk about in the book is for instance using a Bluetooth speaker and some prompts like this to simulate an Alexa skill or what they call an Alexa app. And so we can, you know, do these sort of engineered uh opportunities to make sure that we're getting the feedback. So allocate that extra time because it's worth the insights. How else are we going to do this? You know, we can't keep waiting for perfect. So we have to get imaginative. we have to uh allow ourselves opportunity to um use the tools that we do have because there are a lot of tools we do have available to us and let's get the insights in and let's get this done and let's normalize this. So with that if we're going to start reporting on this constraint you usually find accessibility findings don't fit standard reports. So if we're not able to use the typical moderation tools, they then don't always feed easily into the standard reporting pipelines. Also, explaining disability specific findings requires extra context and grounding because again, if it's not normalized right now, then it's uh stands to reason that your team may not be as familiar with what those considerations are and what they should be looking out for. Teams also may feel unsure about how to present insights in a way that others understand. very similar to the previous point that folks may not even feel competent enough to explain what happened or being able to convey uh the insights for action items and recommendations. But the reality is that accessibility insights belong in every report. So we need to ma uh be mindful that initial reports that include accessibility insights or disability focused insights may feel non-standard at first, but that's how we get it to become a standard. That's that's what sets the precedent. Inclusive insights become commonplace only when they're repeated. So something has to be the first in order for something to become the standard. So we have to just again change our mindset and decide that we're going to do this regardless. Also accessibility findings should be part of the same narrative as all other user feedback. Again, this is not that usability study. This is not uh that sorry that accessibility study. This is not separate but not equal. Uh this is part of what research should include. So again we have to start with report number one but eventually there will be report number 20 and everyone will get used to doing this on a cadence. So make findings visible, understandable and a and actionable. Weave those accessibility uh insights into your core findings and metrics. And here I want to flag um report those confirmed findings not your projected issues. So, if you are new to this, ask your participants, was that an issue or only site what they said was an issue or what they said they would like. Don't project. Don't say, well, you know, the screen reader read it like this, so this needs to be fixed or something didn't come up uh when they, you know, tried this action. This must be a bug. Let's let's confirm with our participants, but then weave that into the core findings and the metrics in the report. This is a finding that you need to put in. But also, if you want to make it more understandable, you can demo it. Have live readouts, not just written reports, and use the videos or even demo it yourself. Um, so this is something I talk about in the book as well that I had to do because I found that my written report was too dry and I was using too many words to try to explain what was going on. So, I just demoed it. That's going to be engaging. That's going to be uh memorable and that's going to drive people to take action. You can also go the extra mile and create pathways for participants to sit directly with your teammates. Consider contracting with them. If they are very technical, if they can explain their issues or if you want to know, did you get it right? If you make a fix, invite them back. Contract with them back and let's, you know, again, break out of these uh cycles that we think it's a oneanddone. Uh we got your insights and now we have to guess at, you know, whether or not we're going to incorporate it. Make it a common practice and a common theme and bring those folks back to get those insights. It's okay to be flexible. So you don't need to ask everything every time, but you do need to keep learning over time. So the other thing I just want to keep in mind is I'm not saying that we need to ask the same questions over and over. I'm not saying that we need to do research on every single decision that we try to make about a product um or that we can't take those insights and port them to other products. Research should be building knowledge over time. So you don't need necessarily to have the same participants and the same studies um and the same questions asked over and over. But by doing this and making this a habit, you are learning over time. You are learning the patterns. you can now be preventative and not reactive in including inclusive uh considerations. You can now be uh intelligent about those decisions. So um that is what we're trying to get to. How do we get to the point where this is a repeated practice? So wrapping up there's some final thoughts that I have which is basically that good research starts by asking. So again, if we go back to this point of how do we make this easy or how do we make this practical or how do we make this straightforward, just keep in mind you don't need the full product to get started. Even a simple interview setup can yield valuable um results or insights. So let participants explain what works for them. So consider communication needs like the captions or pacing or format. you know, ask participants when you're screening, is there something I can do to make this study as accessible as possible for you? Put those considerations in place, but make it low um effort and and low effort to participate. Then, um do it and remember that diversity uh disability is diverse. So, engage a breath of participants. everyone from someone with ADHD and autism, blindness, deafness, uh a speech difference, you know, a mobility disability. There's so many different perspectives that people have because of their disability. And that diversity is only going to um just grow you as a person and grow your organization. It really is going to be helpful. And I really encourage you to just do it. To steal Nike's um slogan, just do it. just set up the call or set up the video call, the Zoom call, whatever it looks like. Set up the email, set up the survey and start getting the insights. All right, so you don't need perfection to start. Just curiosity and care. So with that, I thank you so much. I have a QR code here if that's valuable for folks who were interested in the book. Um, and also I believe they were going to put that in the chat. I'm Michelle with one L, Michelle A. Williams, PhD on LinkedIn. And again, I'm a UX and accessibility consultant and my company is making accessibility work. maww consulting llc.com. So I'd love to connect with you and I thank you and smashing for the time. >> Oh jeez. Do you hear that everyone? Just do it right. Be like Nike and just do it. I love that. Um, you know, Michelle, first of all, thank you for your presentation. Um, you know, I'm walking away with a heck of a lot here. Um because as a designer myself, the whole concept of rapid prototyping really stuck with me. Um you know, I think that there's a temptation to design first and ask questions later. But your example of a rapid prototype is a good demonstration, you know, that the one that you created in Google Sites. It's a good demonstration of focusing on structure first. Like where and how do design and prototypes intersect in the workflow as you understand it? because you know like I think that there is that temptation to overwork it and get really high fidelity really fast. >> So that's the thing you are doing rapid prototyping as you design. You're just not stopping and letting us see it, you know, until you've perfected it. And also you're doing rapid prototyping just in a tool that we can't use for accessibility research such as Figma. So it is uh going to be up to the designer to have this consciousness of these moments where a big maybe pivot or a big decision is being made and before we make it or before we go too far with it maybe there's opportunity to get insight along the way. So that's what I would say that just recognize that these things are already happening. Um, and then recognize how maybe disability inclusion or research in general can all fit into what's already happening with just a little bit of a mindset shift and a consciousness. You know, I'm about the research angle in that too because another part of the design thinking process oftentimes is that we want to understand who our users are and research that, you know, into into very segmented details where we classify or you may even want to say stereotype, you know, people into very, you know, into what we call personas. like there's there's been a practice and and I mean it's it's gained attention recently because government entities have done this as well, but they've released like inclusive personas to try to target specific disabilities and conditions. What are your thoughts on that sort of practice in the process? So, I'm not the biggest fan of personas and archetypes to your point because they do stereotype and they do try to condense too many considerations into buckets. Um however um we have to organize this somehow and a lot of times categories like disability categories or prototypes and archetypes help us at least to be systematic in who we're thinking about and what considerations we're thinking about and building the habit of thinking about such diverse considerations. So to that extent I feel like it if it gets you to think about someone you would not have automatically thought about then it's great. Just recognize that that's a starting point that then helps you to validate it with real users on the back end. So again, if you have to put something in front of someone, try to put the most accessible and inclusive thing you can in front of them by using those as tools, but then recognize that there still is going to be some iterative feedback to come back and be open for that and give opportunities for that. >> I think that's fantastic. the whole idea of getting in the browser as soon as possible before you've put anything down into documentation or into, you know, hard pixels, whatever, makes makes a lot of sense there. So, I think those are really practical takeaways that we can all, you know, um, take into our our work. So, thank you for that.",
