  "fullText": "What if Chad GPT had perfect memory and never hallucinated? That is the $40 billion promise that Rag is making to the industry. Rag is retrieval augmented generation. In this video, you're going to get a one-stop shop that unpacks all the current debates, all the current best practices on Rag, how companies are implementing RAG, a few success stories, and not to be left out, a few places where you should not use Rag. because yes, there are companies that have absolutely overinvested in rag and profoundly regret it. So, let's dive in. The problem is fundamentally that LLM are brilliant but jagged. I've talked about this before. They have fatal flaws. They have knowledge cutoff dates, so their knowledge is frozen in time. They have hallucinations or confident lies and they obviously can't access your company's data, which in most cases companies do not mind. So the solution preview is basically rag plus an LLM or large language model will give your AI a realtime research assistant flavor. So what you're going to learn is how to build your rag system, how to scale from a prototype up to true scale like millions of queries and how to avoid the pitfalls that kill so many rag projects. This is all based on actual deep dives I've done on rag. Lots of research I've done. It's very comprehensive. So, bookmark this one and watch it in chunks. First, why Rag changes everything. We're going to actually get into the stakes and then we're going to get into how it actually works. Rag is currently a roughly $2 billion market, although that's exploding so fast it's hard to measure. It is on track for $40 billion plus by 2035. So many enterprises use rag. The loose running number is around 80%. And they use it over fine-tuning because they perceive it as easier. So, fine-tuning a model is perceived as more difficult, at least right now. And those that are engaging with AI, 73% of them say that they need real- time data access. By the way, if you're wondering where am I making up these statistics from, I have a list of links in my Substack that you can go and follow up to find all of the actual stories that underly this. So, as an example of a success story, LinkedIn had a significant reduction in support ticket resolution time because of rag. because RAG enabled them to know their business. So, it's like an LLM having an openbook exam instead of a closed book exam. And yes, that story is public. So, how does it work? What's the magic? Retrieval is searching the knowledge base for relevant info. Augmentation is combining the query with retrieved facts. And generation is an LLM creating an answer grounded in real data. So, how does rag really work? Number one, embeddings. So text is embedded as numbers in dimensional space, highdimensional space. For example, the phrase refund policy might be embedded as a series of numbers or vectors. And the key insight is that similar meanings will cluster together mathematically. If you've watched previous videos of mine talking about how large language models work, it's the same darn thing. You're taking the words and you're encoding them as numbers in highdimensional vector space. And if you want to know how many dimensions, one of the best practices right now is 1,536 dimensions. That's a lot of dimensions. So if you have the dimensions, you might wonder, is that enough? Can we just feed the text raw? The answer is no. You want to chunk. And by chunking, we mean that you want to break the large blocks of text that you're giving to the system into pieces in ways that help the LLM understand relationships and semantic meaning. Bad chunking ruins. so many rag projects. So pay attention. You have four different strategies here. You can have fixed size chunks that can be dangerous. It can cut off mid-sentence. You can have sentencebased chunks that will respect boundaries. And you have semantic chunks that group by topic. And you have recursive chunks that group by hierarchical structure. The key is making sure you understand what you want to get from a business perspective and driving your chunking strategy off of that. You should plan to have overlap between chunks. You don't want to have just a 0 0 cut off because if you do then you don't have the chance for the LLM to find something in a similar chunk that it might have run across in the original chunk. And that basically if you give it a little overlap, you maximize the odds of the AI finding what it needs in a really complicated haststack. So when we're looking at things in vector space, we are not keyword matching. That's often a misunderstanding. People will say, \"Oh, the LLM is looking for a keyword match.\" No, it's not. It's looking to match meaning. And so, it's actually looking for what's called cosign similarity and finding the nearest neighbors in vector space. As an example, how do I get my money back? Might be a query that a customer types in. That would find, say, refund processing 0.95 similarity, return policy 93 similarity, and shipping info 38 similarity not retrieved. That one's not a fit. Now, if you want to like think about how you handle retrieval, you can actually rerank based on how you get actual queries back and you can boost accuracy for business purposes significantly if you do re-ranking. It's an advanced technique, but in this situation, if you want the system to retrieve shipping info with how do I get my money back because maybe they need to ship their item back, then you can rerank and you can get to that in what we'll call postp production, for lack of a better term. Okay, so how do you build a rag? Very simply, I would recommend like go to Llama index. You're going to load up your documents, which Llama gives you a way to do from the command line. Create an index and query. And it's easy to get a stack for this. This is not expensive. This is not hard as simple. Rag is quick. Uh you can use lang chain. It's a Swiss Army knife. It's going to do everything. You can use llama index. It's optimized specifically for rag. other vector DBs, Pine Cone, Chroma, Cudrant, they all work. And if you want something as simple as what's the warranty period on a manual or handbook, you're going to be able to get 2 years for EU purchases or a similar answer that's correct very, very quickly. Like this is something where in 2025 it's not hard to build a simple rag. The challenge is most people don't just want a simple rag. So if you want a level one basic Q&A, you can get that one done in like a week or so, right? even at a company. Simple vector search, single source, couple of seconds of latency, internal FAQs only, super fast. It's basically a slightly fancier custom GPT. Level two, hybrid search, where you're combining both a keyword match and semantic meaning match. That's a little bit more complicated. You definitely get better accuracy. It can be faster in some cases because you're handling keywords directly. Uh, and it can be helpful for handling edge cases. It's much more complicated to implement though. But it gets more complicated from there. All right, level three. Let's say you want to search text and images and video and audio. Modal rag. It can be quite accurate. You can get it to be quick. Uh but you are going to have to put a ton of work in on the data side and the chunking side. You think chunking is complex complex with text? Wait till you're trying to come up with a chunking strategy for text and images and video and audio. One example would be uh Vimeo's video search with timestamps. That's an interesting one, right? So, level four, agentic rag. That's where you actually have the agent go in and do multi-step reasoning and self-improve on what it finds. It's going to be a longer wait. You can get a more accurate response. You not only have to build a full rag, you have to build an agent over the top. And then finally, if you want enterprise production, there's a lot of security. There's a lot of compliance. There's a lot of monitoring. You have performance expectations around how fast this thing needs to respond and how it handles load when there's multiple queries and all of that additional software engineering that goes into putting something on a million boxes. That does not go away. That is still complicated. No AI will magically put software that lives on a million or 10 million or 100 million boxes easily. Okay. So, we've talked a fair bit about data. Let's do a little bit more of a deep dive there because data is the key to a good rag system. So when you are looking at documents for a rag, there's a few things that you want to keep in mind as like trusty tool tips that will help you to go farther. Number one, PDFs often have terrible header and footer pollution. Like they have stuff where like, have you ever copied and pasted a PDF? Like that's how that's how the system sees it and it will read those little footers and get confused. It'll read the weird header and get confused. OCR for scan documents. Are you sure the optical character recognition is correct? This is why Mistl released a special OCR tool just for scanning documents. It's difficult to get a good rag if you don't have good clean text that's digital. Tables are going to need special handling because you have to encode spatial relationships. You need to get to clean boilerplate in documents before thinking about chunking. Do not try to chunk a PDF. Get to clean boilerplate first. Get to clean markdown first. Okay. metadata can be a dramatically impactful choice as far as how you handle accuracy. So if you add source, section, and date to each chunk, retrieval is going to be vastly improved. For example, policy updated March 20, now the system knows that it's a 2024 update. And if it finds a 2025 update, it's going to probably choose the 2025 update if it understands you're looking for a recency based retrieval. So what does this look like? 10 steps. Convert to text with the appropriate parser. You got to split it into sections. You have to remove the boiler plate that's like crappy headers and footers. You have to normalize all the white space. You have to extract the section titles. You have to add the metadata. You have to chunk with the overlap. You have to embed the chunks. You have to verify samples. And then you have to iterate. That's how much work it is. And that is for frankly a fairly simple exercise. And this is why I say like rag can get complicated. But we're going to get even more advanced because this is one of those videos. Let's talk about graph rag. So traditional rag is just isolated text chunks. Graph rag preserves entity relationships as it encodes in a rag. And so LinkedIn saw significantly better retrieval with knowledge graphs from graph rag. Another hybrid approach that's interesting is search deep dive. And so can you catch exact matches or error codes with a hybrid search that not only looks at like the vector space but also looks at for example error codes. So the best document often ranks in different searches at different positions and it's sort of like rank choice voting where it's looking for like what is the retrieval answer that is highest across these different search methods in our hybrid search approach. And then maybe that's the number one, right? So maybe the error code that we're looking for ranks really highly in our keyword search and it ranks not as highly in the semantic meaning search, but it's still there because we've used correct metadata when we chunked it. And so it all sort of comes out in the wash and it comes out as number one combined and that improves the accuracy. Multimodal, you want to be thoughtful about how you handle especially the relationship between image, table, and text. Invoices are a good example of this. They will often have tables. They'll definitely have text. They may have images as well. You want to use something like uh a tool like clip for image embeddings. You want to unify an index across all your modalities. So unified index for text and images and tables. And you should be, if you do it right, able to send a query that says something like, \"Show me the revenue table from Q3.\" And it should retrieve both the image and the data because the index is common across both modalities. Okay, this is where I mention MCP. MCP is helpful because it ends up being like the USB port for AI. It's a universal protocol to enable AI data connectivity. and it is super super helpful to enable systems to plug into and access data that they would not otherwise be able to get. And so a good system that has rag for internal company data can also extend that search relatively easily using MCP to other data sources as well. Let's get to memory management. So if you think about memory, part of the whole reason we got here is memory and why memory is a problem for AI. We have to get the memory right. Context windows are working memory. It's what every AI ships with. Often it's 100,000, 200,000, 400,000, maybe even a million tokens. Vector stores long-term memory. We've talked about embeddings. Long-term memory, effectively unlimited that we have get compressed and summarized. And so, if you think about how all of this relates together, you can be in a position where you can compress old terms of conversation and summarize them in memory. You can retrieve previous conversation with a rag on the conversation itself. You can have multiple abstraction levels. And one good example is making sure that you can encode enough of a previous longrunning conversation to not forget key facts. So as an example, let's say you're ordering French fries, right? And you're talking with an AI bot about ordering French fries. It is 2025. That could happen. Maybe you're on Door Dash. I don't know what happens if you mention that the order you're working on doesn't have enough fries in it and you want extra fries and that's on the second chat that you send and then 20 or 30 chats later cuz you're having a great conversation with Door Dash uh as we all do um it forgets it forgets that you have French fries. That kind of visceral moment where it forgets the previous conversation is something almost everyone has experienced with AI and you don't have to experience it with a rag system because the rag system can effectively be used as an advanced memory manager to re reduce that sense that the me memory is just going to disappear as the context window moves along. A lot of the fancy work that companies do to keep context windows open a long time basically revolves down to this fancy memory management. This is one of the reasons why OpenAI feels like it has a larger context window even though it doesn't. They don't exactly reveal what they do, but basically they do some fancy work with memory management to keep the conversation flowing longer. Whereas Claude has a pretty hard memory cap and they aren't keeping the conversation longer with a technique like this right now at least. And so you'll run into the you've run out of memory on Claude really fast. And what's fascinating is people think that means that Claude has shorter context windows and shorter memory. But that's not true. OpenAI is fooling you with fancier memory management. Okay, let's get to evals in testing. Four things that I want to call out. Relevance, are we retrieving the right chunks? Faithfulness, is the answer based on actual sources? Quality, would a human rate it as correct? And latency, is this fast enough? And you'll have to set that bar, but oftentimes it's like sub a couple of seconds. And so you need to start this by building a eval set, a question set for this rag that you will consider gold standard. Include edge cases, include things that are tricky. Don't make it easy. You want to measure both retrieval and generation. So can it get it and can it write it well? And you want to AB test improvements in your rag system. If you're going to move to hybrid search, take it seriously. One example, uh, Notion worked on AB testing their rag system when they moved and they could prove the improved value of search over time and so they were able to analyze their failures, fix their data and problems. That's another publicly available story. Okay, I've given you some examples of how to do rag. Let's talk about how rag goes wrong. We've talked about chunking going wrong, breaking context midsentence. We've talked about LLM's missing info in big chunks and how things get lost in memory. Well, it's possible if you set up a bad rag that you can actually get lost in the middle because the LM can't retrieve the info. So, that's a way that rag can actually make the memory problem worse if you implement it badly. You have hallucination horror stories where the rag will make up facts despite the context being available. That can happen with poorly labeled context. It can happen for a variety of reasons. Number four, you can have frankly an incorrect vector DB setup. It can be very expensive. Number five, you can have stale data or bad data inside it. So there's no update pipeline and the data gets out of date and then it's useless. Number six, security leaks, PII exposure, compliance failures. It's just not fun. And number seven, mismatching on embeddings. Different models for index versus query can lead to complete garbledegook. So as you would expect, the prevention strategies make a lot of sense here. Always overlap your chunks. Test with production-like data. Let it be okay to have I don't know responses. That really helps with hallucinations. Start with open- source or cheap options. That prevents you from having the wrong vector database. You can just before you pour the concrete, just check it, right? Build update pipelines on day one. Don't build them later. Have a security review before you start on the architecture. Track embedding versions so you don't have different embedding versions that screw you over between index and query. Okay. Now, let's get into some of the challenges that occur especially when you have very large systems like enterprise and scale systems scaling to 10 million queries, right? You have to start to shard your vector DB and replicate it. You have to cache popular queries. You have to figure out how to cascade models. You may want to expand a prompt and then have a different model handle the prompt from there. Cost optimization will save you millions of dollars because it's so expensive to run these things. And so this is where like you'll be shaving models and figuring out what is the absolute smallest model you can use and how do you trade off different models in a system depending on the query. You're going to have a security deep deep dive like no other. access control filtering, PII scrubbing, audit trails, compliance, HIPPA, GDPR, SOCK 2, you name it. Add an acronym, right? There's going to be a lot. Plan for it to take months, but it's worth it, right? Like another example is RBC banking. They built a rag for support agents, another publicly available story. It indexes policies, it indexes past tickets, faster resolution, better consistency, and they rolled it out internally at first and then to customers. It is possible to do ragged scale. Let's do just a little bit of a look at rag versus agentic search as we come toward the end of this long introduction. Thank you for staying with me to rag. So rag versus agentic search is a huge question. Fundamentally rag is a single retrieval answer modality whereas agents are thinking and planning in multi-step and they can be more accuracy but they're much slower and more expensive. So you want to use rag for simple Q&A for documentation. You want to use rag and agents for complex reasoning, multissource, etc. And I would be remiss even in a video that's all about rag if I did not say when not to use rag. I know of companies that have they have regretted their rag implementations. Because what they used rag for was not company data, not something that the LLM could not get any other way. What they used it for was essentially a way to make the LLM temporarily smarter. And what they found after a very expensive halfmillion dollar million dollar implementation is, oh no, we implemented a rag and the next general purpose model was smart enough it didn't matter. It had a big enough context window it didn't matter. We still need rag. It just needs to be intelligent. It needs to be smart. It needs to follow some of the best practices I've outlined here around how you handle data, how you chunk data, why you use it, how you set it up. So here's some examples that are kind of when not to use rag. Things you can do to avoid making those kinds of mistakes. Number one, check if the base model knows it or almost knows it. I mentioned that already. Number two, this is more for a personal rag system, but if it's for stories or poems or creative writing, rag just generally doesn't work well because the semantic meaning doesn't work the same way. Number three, if you need it to be super super fast, like gaming system fast, don't bother with a rag. It's not going to work ever. uh because you just have to go and get the data and it takes time. If you have highly volatile data like stock market tickers, don't use a rag. It's not going to ever work. If you have a high maintenance cost and you don't have a really clear benefit, like if it's a small data set, don't use a rag. If you have relatively simple transformations, like basic calculations, basic formatting, there's not a lot to do, don't use a rag. It's not worth it. If it's privacy critical, you have to ensure you can't store user data. And if you do, you're in trouble. Now if we look to the future and what's going to happen, I think there's some clear writing on the wall. One, the models are going to get more agentic and smarter. That means rag is going to become more and more agentic search rag, more and more agentic search plus MCP rag, and they are going to make active progress on the memory side, which leads you to ask me, well, heck, if they're going to get the memory figured out, why are we using rag? And my answer to you is rag is a way of talking with data that has a little bit of stability, a widespread good topic diffusion, and that you can actually query against that data in a way that enriches current conversations. You actually would not want to populate a magical 10 million token working memory with your entire wiki of your company anyway because it would just make your answers dirty. What you want is retrieval augmented generation sometime because it gives you a precise picture of a larger data set that is relevant to your query. So rag will have its place even as memory improves but only if you use it smartly. So expect more context windows million plus context windows are going to be typical. Expect a rapid spread of model context protocol and MCP. expect huge market growth as companies start to use rag as a way of bridging the world of their data with AI models and expect a much more sophisticated relationship between model fine-tuning and rag. I would expect that fine-tuning becomes much more democratized in 2026 just as rag is really common now in 2025. Okay, so we've walked through a lot of this. We've walked through how to set up a rag. We've walked through some of the pitfalls with rags, how rag works, how data works, how chunking works. I want to leave you with this. Rag is a way to solve some of AI's biggest problems. Hallucination, stale knowledge, lack of memory. It can be started as simple as a few lines of code. And it does scale up to the enterprise scale, although not with 15 lines of code. This is why so many enterprises and businesses are thinking about Ragen moving toward Brack. It solves problems that are real if implemented well. The tools do exist today. I've mentioned some of them on this video. You have no excuses not to start if you have a problem that fits in the fairly wide rag problem space. Most of us have run across hallucination stale a stale knowledge and memory issues. But if you're going to do it, pick a small use case. Build just a prototype to start. Don't pour the concrete. Measure the impact and eval it. Evaluate it and then learn and iterate. The companies that win are not going to be the companies that just have the magical biggest models. The size doesn't matter, right? the smartness of the model is not going to be the magic thing. It's going to be their ability to take AI integrate it into their company data and knowledge maybe with rag and in ultimately enable AI to drive their workflows forward. That's what I would suggest you think about for rag in your situation. What problems are ragshaped for you? And critically, what problems do you want to avoid using rag on? Because if you've watched this video this far, you know I'm not trying to tell you rag is the solution for everything. I just want you to understand what it is so you're not surprised the next time someone talks to you about it. Cheers. I hope you've enjoyed this introduction to Rack.",
