  IndyDevDan here, super excited to say: Agentic Horizon Lesson 5 (TAC 13) is
  officially live on (link below).

  Huge thanks to every engineer that's a member and has taken Tactical Agentic
  Coding and Agentic Horizon - your feedback and votes were key to making this
  lesson happen (and the FINAL LESSON as well).


  For all non-members, this video is a sneak peak of the full lesson available
  to Agentic Horizon members.

  If you're interesting you can unlock this lesson and others by purchasing
  Tactical Agentic Coding AND Agentic Horizon.

  Let me be clear, TAC and AH is not for beginners. See the landing page for
  more details.

  🤖 Traditional software gets smarter with every use - storing analytics,
  patterns, and data that power better algorithms. But AI agents today? They
  execute and forget. Every. Single. Time.


  The real problem isn't bad context engineering or weak prompt engineering.
  It's that your agents don't learn. Memory files force global context but
  require manual updates. Prime prompts, sub-agents, and skills are powerful but
  YOU have to manually steer them every time you want to add new information.


  🔥 What if your agents could turn actions into expertise automatically? What
  if they could learn WITHOUT human intervention? That's the difference between
  generic agents and agent experts.


  Generic agents execute and forget. Agent experts execute and LEARN.


  💡 In this game-changing video, we reveal how to build agents that act, learn,
  and reuse expertise at runtime with NO human in the loop. Real experts don't
  relearn their craft every time - they have a mental model that evolves with
  each useful action. That's exactly what we're building here.


  🛠️ We dive deep into meta agentics - the atoms that make up agent experts.
  You'll learn how to build meta prompts (prompts that write prompts), meta
  agents (agents that build agents), and meta skills (skills that create
  skills). These are the foundational tools every agentic engineer needs in
  their arsenal.


  🚀 Watch as we demonstrate our orchestrator agent operating a multi-agent
  system where WebSocket experts and database experts maintain their own
  expertise files - concrete mental models of their problem space. These agents
  validate their understanding against the actual code, update automatically,
  and become more proficient with zero manual intervention.


  ⚡ We'll show you how to scale compute by deploying three, five, or ten agent
  experts against a single question to co-locate on the right answer. See how
  tactical agentic coding transforms from one-shot prompts to self-improving
  systems that handle planning, building, AND learning.


  🌟 This is the future of agentic coding - where agents don't just execute your
  commands, they accumulate expertise around the specific problems that matter
  most to you, your business, and your customers. This is how you build agents
  that improve as they're used, just like traditional software, but powered by
  AI.


  Key insights:

  - Build self-improving template metaprompts that learn at runtime

  - Create expertise files that serve as mental models for your agents

  - Use multi-agent orchestration to validate answers with high confidence

  - Implement the three-step workflow: plan, build, self-improve

  - Scale up compute by deploying multiple experts against critical problems

  - Understand why the code is ALWAYS the source of truth (not docs, not
  comments)


  💼 The game never ends except when your agents stop learning. I don't know
  about you, but I want experts operating my codebase and products - not generic
  agents I have to manually manage every single time.


  Stay focused and keep building.
